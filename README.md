            1.  (Note to anyone reading: I will breathe vim until my dying breath, but after thinking long and hard about it, for a language like Python that has such a powerful, FOSS IDE like PyCharm, the time, complexity, **stability**, and cross-platform cost to get a similar environment working is just too high.
            
                1.  also, "org-mode" alone justifies at least some usage of Emacs/Spacemacs ;)
            
            2.  :( in thinking about vim autocomplete working with libraries etc., didn't even think about if they have anaconda/environment support&#x2026;which this <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/414vx1/vim_best_way_to_setup_autocomplete_for_python_3/cz0j415/> says it's more trouble than it's worth
            
            3.  more likewise vim failure comments <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/copik/can_you_autocomplete_function_returns_in_vim/c0u3nyq/>
            
            4.  These and similar posts on r python make it VERY clear that the plugins powering python in vim are not as feature complete, integrated, or powerful as those in a real ide like pycharm

                1.  just discovered that in vim, can search for newlines with '\n' a la \`s/\n/???/g\`, but only way to insert a newline is with '\r', a la \`s/\n  \n/\r/g\`

            8.  emacs notes
            
                1.  general emacs notes
                
                    -   "redo" is weird, some kind of circular buffer
                    -   to switch the "direction" of un/redoing, hit C-r it seems
                    -   how to browse websites?
                    -   mark (for region select) is set by C-space (since I had to rebind tmux :()
                    -   due to super different emacs indention, in Insert mode, can only force a "new" indent via M-i
                
                2.  tutorial notes (a la emacs mode)
                
                    -   C-v and M-v move forward and back a screenful (save for 2 lines so you can read continuously)
                    -   h and l in vim correspond to C-b and C-f
                    -   j and k in vim correspond to C-n and C-p
                    -   b and e (words) in vim " to M-b and M-f
                    -   "meta is usu acting on objects of the language, like sentences, whereas ctrl is usually for raw text"
                    -   0 and $(9, for me) in vim " C-a and C-e
                    -   ( and ) (sentences) in vim " M-a and M-e (Emacs' sentence detection is far superior)
                    -   the cursor location is the "point"
                    -   M-< and M-> move to the beginning/end of buffer
                    -   instead of just prefixing command with a number (since it would type the number), either "M-<number> <command>" or prefixing with "C-u <number> <command>" works; the latter is recommended
                        -   the number in this case is called a "prefix argument"
                            -   for some commands, the mere presence of a number changes the fundamental behavior of the commands, meaning it acts as a "flag" instead - this is not true of anything so far
                        -   thus, C-u 8 C-f moves forward 8 chars.
                        -   this can also be used for individual characters, like C-u 8 a
                        -   there are some exceptions, like how "C-u <number> C-v" SCROLLS by <number> lines
                    -   C-g is sort of the universal "interrupt and exit command entering"
                    -   some commands are disabled for new users, where typing them opens a window explaining them
                    -   Emacs, according to its descriptions, appears to have vim-like newlines, where they're simply treated as their own character
                    -   windows
                        -   C-x 1 closes all windows except one
                    -   killing/yanking = cutting/pasting
                    -   deletion
                        -   Emacs calls backspace <DEL>, NOT the same as the usual delete key
                            -   despite this nomenclature, it is not considered a control character
                        -   Emacs can use C-d as the "delete next character" key, or colloquial delete
                        -   M-<DEL> deletes the previous WORD, and M-d deletes thee next word
                        -   when any of these are given an argument, they kill instead of deleting
                    -   killing
                        -   "killing" means you can reinsert the text, while you can only undo deletion
                        -   C-k kills from cursor to end of line, and M-k kills to the end of the sentence
                            -   this means, to kill a line AND the newline at the end, you need to hit C-k twice; however, C-u 2 C-k will instead kill 2 whole lines AND their newlines
                        -   C-w kills a region, selected by making a mark via hitting C-space, and then moving the cursor
                    -   yanking
                        -   "yanking" is the REINSERTION of killed text
                        -   C-y is the basic yank command
                        -   once text is yanked in, can hit M-y repeatedly to exchange the text with earlier kills
                    -   undo
                        -   C-/ is the basic one
                            -   C-\_ and C-x u are both identical to this
                            -   all equivalences accept a numeric prefix argument as the number of undos
                        -   just like vim, undoing has no effect on the kill ring
                        -   just like vim, commands that don't change the text aren't undone
                    -   files
                        -   opening files are called "finding" or "visiting" them
                        -   C-x C-f opens a "minibuffer" for looking for a file
                            -   has rudimentary text completion, including "ls" of the dir in a new window upon TABBING
                            -   this is also how you create new files
                        -   C-x C-s saves changes to a buffer to a file
                    -   buffers
                        -   C-x C-b lists all the buffers
                        -   ALL things with text in Emacs exist in buffers
                        -   you can reopen a buffer you have been editing with C-x C-f, same as finding the file, or C-x b
                        -   not all buffers are files, like **Buffer List**, and **Messages**, and **scratch**
                        -   you are free to navigate to other buffers without saving your changes in some
                        -   C-x s conveniently asks you if you want to save all changes made to all modiifed buffers
                    -   Extended commands
                        -   C-x is "Character extend", and is followed by a character
                        -   M-x is "Named command extend", and followed by a long name
                
                3.  whoa, apparently a vertical split with the large \`projects.org\` file causes interaction to slow down significantly? but not when it's in a single window in emacs, or even horiz split&#x2026;

                        1.  go to the section marked "python environment", where it talks about ipython integration in Emacs, essentially a REPL
                    
                    2.  the "python-mode" (and maybe necessary "ipython") packages from Marmalade enable a REPL apparently

            12. org-mode notes
            
                1.  simple commands
                
                    1.  \`tab\` cycles
                    
                    2.  \`C-c t\` cycles through TODO-DONE-blank for a correctly formatted star/headline item
                    
                    3.  \`C-c , <either case priority letter>\` gives an priority to that item, though it needs to be a TODO to show up on agenda
                    
                    4.  whoa, apparently the below two work not just on org headers, but also markdown-style unordered lists! however, they convert any ordered lists into unordered lists in this case
                    
                    5.  \`M-return\` basically gives you new headings at the 'current' level. It either
                    
                        1.  if it's not a header already, adds beginning stars to current line, turning it into heading of the 'most recent' order (top-to-bottom), or
                        
                        2.  if the line is already at that level heading AND the cursor is NOT in the first column, starts a new heading on the line below it that's ready for text input, moving all text to the right of the cursor (including under it) down to that new header. (This means a clean heading is created below if you're in Insert mode at the end of the above heading.)
                        
                        3.  if the line is already at that level heading AND the cursor IS in the first column, starts a new heading on the line ABOVE it that's ready for text input (so can then M-down to move it)
                    
                    6.  \`M-left/right\` left = moves header to a higher level (less stars), right = lowers heading level. (This works too en masse for Visual general selection, even taking care of non-header material correctly, but not Visual Block / vertical selection.)
                    
                    7.  \`M-down/up\` down = moves current header down the buffer amongst headers of the same level, keeping the cursor on it, and likewise for up; stops when reaching a header of a higher level.
                
                2.  install
                
                    1.  there is a bug using ELPA packages etc. where you must not call ANY org functions before installing the FULL org package correctly - this means you need to comment out org settings set in ~/.emacs. It's dumb.
                
                3.  you have to install capture mode - see the manual - where you use \`C-c c\`
                
                4.  MobileOrg
                
                    1.  Note that org/relevant-files.org is the "index file" for MobileOrg, so it knows the notes I care about, I guess I have to individually link to them?
                    
                    2.  You add JUST the paths to all the files you want on MobileOrg, not direct files links. Note that this is documented nowhere.

                    1.  monoid is a way of thinking about, the 'type' of a func as the parameter type "to" the return type, and composing funcs to make a new func with the same "type"?
                    
                    2.  essence of a monoid is how you combine multiple things of the same type (like funcs) in order to create a new thing of the same type
                    
                    3.  "types are almost the same thing as [mathematical] sets"
                    
                    4.  "function application" (in func programming) = “calling a function"
                    
                    5.  the syntax is just “f a" since the func is linear? [based on types?]
                    
                    6.  his thought is that constructing complexity by making monoids etc. and combining functions is easier to understand and more controllable
                    
                    7.  can more easily mix and match parts of the system

            1.  Moving away from HDF5 <http://hn.premii.com/#/comments/10858189>
            
            2.  hdf5 woes on debian
            
                1.  trying to install
                
                    1.  have tried hdfview from package - shows empty file, critical bug known since Jan 2017
                    
                    2.  have tried compiling hdfview, after MUCH effort compiling and HDF4 HDF5 libs, unclear compile error when it came to compiling HDFview specifically, possible java error
                    
                    3.  have tried running hdfview from Wine, but not working, maybe since key executable is a batch file 'hdfview.bat'
                    
                    4.  have tried hdf-compass package, gives error when loading example hdf
                    
                        1.  executable: HDFCompass
                        
                        2.  gives similar h5py library error?
                    
                    5.  hdf-compass DOES work on non-pypet test HDF data, issue was pypet data
                    
                    6.  tried "compiling" most recent version of hdf-compass from pypi (0.7b3, vs. the package version of 0.6) via wheel file installation, but failed repeatedly in compiling wxPython/wxWidget dep
                    
                    7.  have tried, from stretch-backports, "silx view" which gives python h5py library error
                    
                    8.  have tried vitables which gives same? h5py library error as silx
                
                2.  only success: using hdf-compass package on non-pypet data, e.g. "data.hdf5
                
                    1.  note: in the readthedocs, the "install" page of HDF-Compass has just a "TBD"&#x2026;and the repo hasn't really been updated in 2 years&#x2026;and HDFView 3.0.0 may be newer than it.
                    
                        1.  in other words, hdf-compass may be dead
                
                3.  can use hdfview on cluster (module) to successfully load pypet hdf files!
                
                4.  why can only hdfview load pypet hdf files (and others), but HDFCompass can only load non-pypet?
                
                    1.  possible answer: pypet hdf uses UTF8 (CSET H5T<sub>CSET</sub><sub>UTF8</sub>) instead of ASCII (CSET H5T<sub>CSET</sub><sub>ASCII</sub>) like data.hdf5 and NWB
                    
                    2.  possible answer: HDFCompass complains that there's no function in v0.6.0 to read CLASS when it's not IMAGE? or something? could be CLASS attribute
                    
                        1.  trying to remove this attribute: LOL that is DEF not the only problem
                
                5.  installed h5check to validate, but pypet hdf files pass validation! wtf?
            
            3.  it seems like, despite hdf5 being made by a standards org, the software leaves a LOT to be desired!

                    -   I have marked with a \* those which I think are absolutely essential
                    -   Items for each section are sorted by oldest to newest. Come back soon for more!
                    -   BASH
                        -   In bash, 'ctrl-r' searches your command history as you type
                        -   Input from the commandline as if it were a file by replacing 'command < file.in' with 'command <<< "some input text"'
                        -   '<sup>'</sup> is a sed-like operator to replace chars from last command 'ls docs; ^docs<sup>web</sup><sup>'</sup> is equal to 'ls web'. The second argument can be empty.
                        -   '!!:n' selects the nth argument of the last command, and '!$' the last arg 'ls file1 file2 file3; cat !!:1-2' shows all files and cats only 1 and 2
                        -   More in-line substitutions: <http://tiny.cc/ecv0cw> <http://tiny.cc/8zbltw>
                        -   'nohup ./long<sub>script</sub> &' to leave stuff in background even if you logout
                        -   'cd -' change to the previous directory you were working on
                        -   'ctrl-x ctrl-e' opens an editor to work with long or complex command lines
                        -   Use traps for cleaning up bash scripts on exit <http://tiny.cc/traps>
                        -   'shopt -s cdspell' automatically fixes your 'cd folder' spelling mistakes
                        -   Add 'set editing-mode vi' in your ~/.inputrc to use the vi keybindings for bash and all readline-enabled applications (python, mysql, etc)
                    -   PSEUDO ALIASES FOR COMMONLY USED LONG COMMANDS
                        -   function lt() { ls -ltrsa "$@" | tail; }

                        -   check my .vimrc <http://tiny.cc/qxzktw> and here <http://tiny.cc/kzzktw> for more
                    -   TOOLS
                        -   'htop' instead of 'top'
                        -   'ranger' is a nice console file manager for vi fans
                        -   Use 'apt-file' to see which package provides that file you're missing
                        -   'dict' is a commandline dictionary
                        -   Learn to use 'find' and 'locate' to look for files
                        -   Compile your own version of 'screen' from the git sources. Most versions have a slow scrolling on a vertical split or even no vertical split at all
                        -   'trash-cli' sends files to the trash instead of deleting them forever. Be very careful with 'rm' or maybe make a wrapper to avoid deleting '\*' by accident (e.g. you want to type 'rm tmp\*' but type 'rm tmp \*')
                        -   'file' gives information about a file, as image dimensions or text encoding
                        -   'sort | uniq' to check for duplicate lines
                        -   'echo start<sub>backup</sub>.sh | at midnight' starts a command at the specified time
                        -   Pipe any command over 'column -t' to nicely align the columns
                        -   Google 'magic sysrq' and learn how to bring you machine back from the dead
                        -   'diff &#x2013;side-by-side fileA.txt fileB.txt | pager' to see a nice diff
                        -   'j.py' <http://tiny.cc/62qjow> remembers your most used folders and is an incredible substitute to browse directories by name instead of 'cd'
                        -   'dropbox<sub>uploader</sub>.sh' <http://tiny.cc/o2qjow> is a fantastic solution to upload by commandline via Dropbox's API if you can't use the official client
                        -   learn to use 'pushd' to save time navigating folders (j.py is better though)
                        -   if you liked the 'psgrep' alias, check 'pgrep' as it is far more powerful
                        -   never run 'chmod o+x \* -R', capitalize the X to avoid executable files. If you want <span class="underline">only</span> executable folders: 'find . -type d -exec chmod g+x {} ;'
                        -   'xargs' gets its input from a pipe and runs some command for each argument
                        -   run jobs in parallel easily: 'ls \*.png | parallel -j4 convert {} {.}.jpg'
                    -   NETWORKING
                        -   Don't know where to start? SMB is usually better than NFS for most cases.
                        -   'sshfs<sub>mount'</sub> is not really stable, any network failure will be troublesome
                        -   'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080' shares all the files in the current folder over HTTP, port 8080
                        -   'ssh -R 12345:localhost:22 server.com "sleep 1000; exit"' forwards server.com's port 12345 to your local ssh port, even if you machine is not externally visible on the net.
                        -   Now you can 'ssh localhost -p 12345' from server.com and you will log into your machine.

            10. lrn-markdown
            
                1.  use orgmode for note-taking system, NOT markdown, stop researching this
                
                    1.  pros for markdown
                    
                        -   plaintext: counter: orgmode already does that
                        -   readability: counter: markdown looks human readable (so does org)
                        -   export: counter: org already has vast export, and Pandoc import, and ANY more md->pandoc functionality can be had by org->md->edits->pandoc
                        -   coolness: markdown is/looks cooler (markdown wins here, but only here, and only slightly)
                        -   keep in mind this is INDEPENDENT of HOW I want to organize either md/org
                    
                    2.  cons for markdown
                    
                        -   would have to recreate huge amount of orgmode, literally everything (agenda building, agenda search, user interface for interacting with agenda)
                        -   would just be adding meta layer (filetags, header tags, etc) on top of markdown just like org

                    1.  \`repmat\` to replicate matrices
                    
                    2.  \`bsxfun\` does some binary operation between two matrices, but if one of them is a less dimensional than the other but still has values in other dimensions, it replicates those vales of the smaller matrix to match the size of the larger one, thus allowing a linear-algebraically correct binary operation on every element of hte larger matrix
                
                3.  documentation generation

                5.  gotchas
                
                    1.  for csv output, use \`dlmwrite()\` function (see below)
                    
                        1.  1. cannot just pass args to \`save()\` function
                        
                        2.  2. \`csvwrite()\` function ONLY saves to 5 significant digits (srsly?)
                        
                        3.  3. must use \`dlmwrite()\` e.g. \`dlmwrite('test.csv', your<sub>data</sub>, 'precision','%10.5f')\` for non-5 sig digits, see <http://stackoverflow.com/a/18428990/2723794>
                        
                            1.  thankfully, \`dlmwrite()\` defaults to comma-delimiting, so don't need to specify that
                            
                            2.  thankfully, \`dlmwrite()\`'s precision argument accepts C-style formatting strings
                    
                    2.  are strings called chars in matlab? blasphemy
                    
                    3.  matlab either previously, or still, doesn't support transparent objects in plots with log <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/13441-bizare-problem-with-facealpha-and-rendering#answer_18342>
                    
                    4.  matlab doesn't let you control transparency/alpha of individual markers e.g. for scatter3 <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/10855-how-can-i-apply-variable-transparency-to-a-plot-using-scatter3>
                    
                    5.  run all plot generation/saving scripts TWICE in a LIVE session: if using a script to save a matlab plot to file, matlab will size/draw ticks on axes and resize the plot DIFFERENTLY depending on IF that plot is already loaded into memory (present in a figure on the screen) or not. So run all plot-saving scripts TWICE
                
                6.  libraries

                9.  best practices
                
                    -   Control Flow
                        -   \`if&#x2026;elif&#x2026;\` is the preferred replacement for any \`case\` or \`switch\` logic
                            -   source: <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements>
                    -   Dicts
                        -   "Looping over dict keys and vals"
                        -   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go#t=1292>
                        -   at 21m30s, "Looping over dict keys and vals"
                        -   \`k, v in dict.items()\` makes a huge list, but is better than \`for k in d\`
                        -   \`for k, v in dict.iteritems()\` is better than .items and returns an iterator
                        -   aka, for iterating over keys AND values in dict, use .iteritems
                        -   "Looping over dict keys"
                        -   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go#t=1292>
                        -   \`for k in dict.keys():\` is better than \`for k in dict\` since makes list
                    -   File I/O
                        -   if you did not open a file with \`with\`, then you need to close the file
                        -   <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python_3/File_IO>
                    -   Logic
                        -   if comparing floats, don't use logical equals \`==\`, instead use \`< epsilon\` where epsilon is some small value.
                        -   this is due to error accumulation in floats, etc.
                    -   2.7
                        -   Use \`xrange\` most? of the time instead of \`range\`
                        -   not a problem in python3
                        -   generally, use \`izip\` instead of \`zip\` for doing stuff over two lists, since \`zip\` makes a copy of both lists in memory and returns a list, whereas \`izip\` returns an iterator only over a certain portion

                            1.  the fig in \`fig, ax = plt.subplots()\` is important, meaning the order of the returned thing from that func matter
                            
                            2.  one sets the ylabels etc. on what appears to be a LIVE \`ax\` object, independent of the name of the \`rects2 = ax.bar()\`
                            
                            3.  one saves the figure with what appears to be a LIVE \`plt\` usage, using \`plt.savefig("file")\`
                            
                            4.  this might explain why parallelizing it is difficult

                        2.  note! you need a gcc-fortran compiler like \`multilib/gcc-fortran-multilib\` in your system to properly install scipy inside a venv

                            2.  note  that the VERSION OF PYTHON the virtualenv you download is in is the version of python it installs
                            
                            3.  run \`virtualenv <-p BIN> ENV\` where BIN is the actual python binary you want to install and ENV is the directory it'll install everything to, and so I typically use '~/python<sub>virtualenvs</sub>/<version>'

            13. lrn-r-language
            
                1.  quick notes
                
                    1.  can check class of an object [does this mean any DATA object in R?] with \`class()\` or check type with \`typeof()\`
                    
                    2.  similarly, can look at structure of any data with \`str()\`
                    
                    3.  <https://github.com/mikelove/r-gotchas>
                    
                    4.  cannot (easily?) add columns of greater length to a data.frame, INCLUDING an empty one. which is annoying, but also means you're not constantly spewing NA values into larger and large data.frames.
                    
                    5.  NA = not available but still a logical type, NULL = more of an "undefined value" type that does NOT work with logic, numerics, etc.
                    
                    6.  ggplot2
                    
                        1.  \`ggplot() + derp\` doesn't like lists of \`geom<sub>line</sub>()\`'s etc., since not functions but rather environments?
                        
                        2.  stackoverflow says to use "faceting" builtin to ggplot2 instead of loop/apply for subplots etc.
                    
                    7.  \`%>%\` is a pipe operator, see <https://github.com/smbache/magrittr> , needs magrittr loaded
                    
                    8.  subsetting data frames: bracket indexing vs use of \`subset()
                    
                        -   the below is how you would grab all columns' information, for the rows that match our search.
                        
                        \`\`\` derp <- melt(df, id='voltages', variable.name='q<sub>value'</sub>, value.name = 'time<sub>constants'</sub>) subset(derp, q<sub>value</sub> %in% 'tau<sub>h</sub><sub>3'</sub>) derp[derp$q<sub>value</sub> %in% "tau<sub>h</sub><sub>3</sub>",] derp[derp$q<sub>value</sub> == "tau<sub>h</sub><sub>3</sub>",] \`\`\`
                        -   bracket indexing ONLY if it ends with a comma, WTF? has to do with how you can use \`derp[1,3]\` or \`derp[,3]\` to access portions of the data frame. First number is row (which is how we're trying to find it), second is column, so using a comma then nothing means "return all columns for the found rows", as opposed to \`,1\` which would return the entries of only the first column, that match the row match we did
                        -   a la \`derp[<rows>, <columns>]\`
                        -   This only appears to make sense for searching down individual columns, since the \`$\` operator implies that you're only talking about columns
                        -   This is still pretty confusing, and there is poor equivalency here between rows and columns &#x2013; much of the behavior is assuming you care about columns
                        -   wickham talks about implementing \`subset()\`, but even though it's easier and saves on keystrokes since it makes assumptions about what your variables are based on the data that you initially supply it with, in longer, more complicated scripts, it can screw up things since it uses dynamic scoping. See <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html#nse>
                        -   ****so it seems for longer scripts, i.e. what i always want to do, it's better to do bracket indexing rather than \`subset()\`.****
                    
                    9.  note on r-lang: to install packages inside R, on linux must install "tk" and "tcl" libraries/programs yourself

                        -   id = sort of our "index variable"
                        -   variable = names of each of the columns; will be turned into R "Factors" a la categorical variable
                        -   values = what they sound like, the actual data
                        -   note that normally, each of the above are turned into fields of the data frame with the exact same name as above! slightly confusing, since they are all so generic
                        -   this worked for getting the values according to a specific "factor", as they are organized in the "variable" field(?)

                8.  packaging
                
                    1.  building R package process, from wickham's <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html>
                    
                        1.  0. install all necessary packages, especially "devtools"
                        
                        2.  1. create base/bare package via \`devtools::create("~/Dropbox/progz/lib/R/dnsimr")\` (Rstudio will install automatically?)
                        
                        3.  2. install if not Rstudio via \`devtools::install("~/Dropbox/progz/lib/R/dnsimr")\` or \`install.packages("~/Dropbox/progz/lib/R/dnsimr", repos=NULL, type="source")\` a la <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1474125/2723794>
                        
                            1.  as developing, can reload package with \`devtools::load<sub>all</sub>("~/Dropbox/progz/lib/R/dnsimr")\`
                
                9.  scripting
                
                    1.  Rscript vs R CMD BATCH (also vs littler) <http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~hjaffee/R_tasks.html>
                    
                        1.  only Rscripts allows "stdout redirection", so whatever use Rscript
                
                10. speed improvements
                
                    1.  faster R <http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/4/25/faster-talk.html>
                    
                    2.  ask mike about usage of "RLLVM" library for just-in-time R compilation
                    
                    3.  mike says Rcpp is easy to use and fast <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html>

                    6.  "Rprof()" for time profiling?

                        6.  notes on <https://www.proteansec.com/linux/the-ultimate-guide-to-mutt/>
                        
                            1.  "The **folder** configuration option defined the mailbox location [like ~/Mail], while"
                            
                            2.  "the **spoolfile** defines our default inbox location. [like ~/Mail/name.surname/Inbox]"
                            
                            3.  Mutt also contains different configuration options regarding different folders:
                            
                                1.  "spoolfile / Inbox":
                                
                                    1.  the startup folder where all the new email is kept: this can be thought as an Inbox folder.
                                
                                2.  "mbox / Archive":
                                
                                    1.  a folder where we can move the read emails, so they don’t show up in spoolfile anymore (but we also don’t want to delete those emails). This can be thought as an Archive folder.
                                
                                3.  "record / Sent Mail":
                                
                                    1.  a folder where sent messages are moved, so we have them archived somewhere in case we need it sometime in the future. This can be thought as a Sent Mail folder.
                                
                                4.  "postponed / Drafts":
                                
                                    1.  a folder where emails that we’ve started to write, but haven’t finished yet are stored. This can be thought as a Drafts folder.
                        
                        7.  extensions
                        
                            1.  goobook for google contacts
                            
                                1.  if gives weird authentication error, then run in bash \`goobook authenticate\`
                                
                                2.  <http://fsk141.com/linux/gooey-google-contact-goodness-with-mutt.html>
                                
                                3.  to install mutt on OS X with Macports, need to throw in "+imap" flag to install
                                
                                    1.  more complicated than that:
                                    
                                        1.  THIS has the answer <http://ajitabhpandey.info/2012/08/installing-mutt-on-mac-os-x/>
                                        
                                            1.  you have to use \`sudo port install mutt-devel +compress+gdbm+gnuregex+gpgme+headercache+imap+pop+sasl+smtp+ssl+trash\`
                                            
                                            2.  this is because the SSL addition doesn't build for some reason without some of the other packages, and not all the things in the other-referenced muttrc's work without these packages
                            
                            2.  offlineimap
                            
                                1.  if cert doesn't work, try putting the first SHA-1 from running \`gnutls-cli -p 993 imap.gmail.com\` into ~/.offlineimaprc
                    
                    5.  tips

                2.  cron
                
                    1.  must change editor to something other than Vim apparently, like by entering to the terminal "$ $EDITOR=nano"
                    2.  enter into the terminal "$ crontab -e" and you'll be able to change the cron thing, where each entry is Argument 1: Minute (0 - 59) Argument 2: Hour (0 - 23) Argument 3: Day of Month (1 - 31) Argument 4: Month (1-12) Argument 5: Day of Week (0 - 6) Sunday = 0 Argument 6: Command

                    1.  \`echo 9 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi<sub>video0</sub>/brightness\` changes screen brightness!
                    
                        1.  max screen brightness for acpi<sub>video0</sub> is 15 - use this one as main
                    
                    2.  \`echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel<sub>backlight</sub>/brightness\` is another screen brightness one, don't use
                    
                        1.  max screen brightness for intel<sub>backlight</sub> is 1808, REALLY - don't bother using this one
                
                2.  copypasta / system clipboard
                
                    1.  main thing: CLIPBOARD buffer is the one I use
                    
                    2.  emacs: omg, the headaches man&#x2026;so on arch, a surefire way / this worked once:
                    
                        1.  do NOT install emacs-nox (i.e. the one without X11 workings), instead install the normal emacs
                        2.  not only that, but do NOT run emacs strictly inside the terminal, i.e. starting it with "emacs &#x2013;no-window-system", as this prevents seemingly any X Primary/Clipboard clipboard buffer interaction
                        3.  Install program \`xclip\`, as you do NOT need programs \`xorg-xclipboard\` or \`xsel\` for copypasta to work
                            -   you can test the Primary/Clipboard clipboard buffers via \`xclip -out -selection primary\` etc.
                        4.  Enjoy - AFAIK, by Emacs >23, you don't even need to \`(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)\` to make it copy to X11's Clipboard clipboard buffer. It should work at this point, but I haven't done it from scratch.
                    
                    3.  get arch copypasta working in vim and terminal emacs
                    
                        
                        -   notes 2014-08-21
                            -   so, with a new and improved \`omgclipboard\`, including now knowing the existence of the \`secondary\` and \`buffer-cut\` buffers
                            -   note that this is after I got the emacs clipboard working, which involved JUST running it in standalone-X-window style outside of the terminal
                            -   copying into buffers
                                -   \`emacs\` (nonterminal, that pops out) copies into the CLIPBOARD buffer
                                -   \`emacs\` terminal does not copy into any buffers! (it does use a program-private buffer though)
                                -   \`vim\` copies into the PRIMARY buffer
                                    -   this includes, that if the vim session is exited, the PRIMARY buffer is emptied
                                    -   this is with either the \`set clipboard=unnamed\` setting on, or NO explicit clipboard setting on in its .vimrc
                                    -   hooray! with \`set clipboard=unnamedplus\` (see the plus), it ONLY uses the CLIPBOARD, not the PRIMARY as before from <http://stackoverflow.com/a/11489440>
                                -   \`firefox\` is complicated
                                    -   \`firefox\` JUST selection of texts actually copies into the PRIMARY (though this usually happens when copying text)
                                    -   ctrl+c or a "real copy" copies its contents into the CLIPBOARD
                                    -   so, what ends up happening most of the time is it copies into both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD
                                -   \`skype\` and \`vinagre\` right-click copies its contents into BOTH PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD
                            -   pasting from buffers
                                -   \`vim\` pastes from the PRIMARY buffer (e.g. from firefox' copying)
                                -   \`firefox\` pastes from the CLIPBOARD buffer
                                -   \`emacs\`, (nonterminal) under evil, pastes weirdness and apparently has an internal buffer, vim-style. Natively, though, it pastes from the CLIPBOARD buffer, as you would expect, since it only writes to the CLIPBOARD one.
                                -   \`emacs\` terminal also doesn't paste from any of the other buffers
                                -   middle mouse in tmux in urxvt pastes something??? just a hyphen? it doesn't appear to be any of the 4 buffers from xclip
                                    -   more testing reveals it pastes a PORTION of the text in the PRIMARY buffer&#x2026;wtf???
                                -   as a test of general desktop stuff, \`skype\` and \`vinagre\` pastes from the CLIPBOARD
                            -   after looking online, apparently many people complain about this with firefox, and it seems difficult to change
                        -   therefore, based on firefox's (and other desktop apps) pasting preference for CLIPBOARD, and the customizability of vim and emacs, the best thing to do is apparently center everything around the CLIPBOARD buffer, e.g.
                            1.  make vim copy/paste from it, and
                                -   vim: to make it use CLIPBOARD, add \`set clipboard=unnamedplus\` in .vimrc, yes!!! a la <http://stackoverflow.com/a/11489440>
                            2.  make terminal-emacs copy/paste from it
                                -   so, nonterminal emacs is fine, it doesn't even need \`(xclip-mode 1)\` in emacs settings to copy/paste to CLIPBOARD, it works out of the box
                                -   terminal emacs (i.e. with '-nw' passed) is more complicated, has two requirements:
                                    1.  emacs needs the TERM environment variable to be set to 'xterm' or 'xterm-256color'
                                        -   this can NOT be done automatically in emacs settings, apparently, even with the \`setenv\` function, since it still doesn't seem to work. Solution now is to add a 'TERM=xterm-256color' definition prior to all alias'd emacs bash aliases, so it's pretty much fixed
                                        -   variants of screen and urxvt will not work! AFAIK this includes 'screen-256color', 'screen', 'rxvt-unicode-256color', 'rxvt-unicode'
                                        -   note that this turns the emacs colors awful, the 'color-theme' package can rectify this
                                    2.  emacs also needs the 'xclip' emacs package (you also need it installed on the system), and you have to turn it on with just \`(xclip-mode 1)\`
                    
                    4.  got copypasta working in urxvt tmux terminal!
                    
                        -   apparently, can do \`ctrl+meta+v\` to paste from X11 CLIPBOARD buffer, judging from the docs at <http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.1.pod>
                            
                            :ID: c6260a97-e525-4a61-857c-9f8a99c3213c
                            
                            :END:
                
                3.  file manager
                
                    1.  can change nautilus settings via running \`dconf-editor\` and going to 'org->nautilus->' to hardcode the objects, or the thing in the upper left duh, or can use \`gnome-tweak-tool\`
                    
                    2.  can use \`locate\` via the 'mlocate' package, must first update with \`sudo updatedb\` - it's pretty fast
                
                4.  file system
                
                    1.  filelight for visualizing hdd space
                
                5.  firefox kde? theme color change bug <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=211139> and <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=137382>
                
                6.  kernel modules
                
                    1.  there are some details in the wireless note
                    
                    2.  the proper place to blacklist things, as per <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_modules#Blacklisting> , is in a \`/etc/modprobe.d/<modprobe|blacklist>.conf\` file where you just put an entry for \`blacklist <module name>\`
                    
                    3.  \`lspci -vnn | grep -7 14e4\` tells us what actual modules are being used by the hardware, in this case the wireless card in a macbook
                    
                    4.  you can see the status of some? modules via \`lsmod\`, and you can see where all the modules are loaded from via \`mkinitcpio -v | less\`
                    
                    5.  you can potentially individually load modules by making files in \`/etc/modules-load.d/<module>.conf\` where the contents is just the module name
                
                7.  keepass / passwords
                
                    1.  had to install custom keepass portable to home dir for FF extension "KeeFox" &#x2013; for deets, see its main wurbsite
                    
                    2.  update: i have no freaking clue where the above wurbsite actually is, it might actual be INSIDE the plugin (via html file)
                    
                    3.  Note: must install \`xsel\` package to get copying directly from KeePass, though still don't have paste TO KeePass
                
                8.  keyboard / keymap
                
                    1.  ctrl-caps swapping? only diff is, as of 2014-12-10, I now use '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us-nocapslock.map.gz' where the Caps<sub>Lock</sub> keycode is turned into Control vis-a-vis <http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/7676>
                    
                    2.  note that this is an update that affects the terminal but NOT X11, which is still dominated by 10-evdev.conf, which now has "ctrl:nocaps" instead of constantly switching "ctrl:swapcaps"
                    
                    3.  now, if NEED capslock, just \`loadkeys &#x2026;/us-capsctrlswap.map.gz\` (or maybe can just do \`loadkeys us-capsctrlswap\`)
                    
                    4.  can set default keymap persistently via \`localectl set-keymap &#x2013;no-convert us-nocapslock\`
                    
                        1.  might be able to do this as well with this, but untested
                        
                            \`\`\`{bash}
                            
                            
                            export KEYMAP=us-nocapslock \`\`\`
                    
                    5.  passing \`alt+L/R arrow\` through virtual console: further edits to '&#x2026;/us-nocapslock.map.gz' from here fix it <http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/146241/94558> (though NOTE that there is a typo in the answer, the second string is F106 not F105, simple and obvious typo)
                
                9.  installing arch
                
                    1.  I think the blog I used to great success was <http://blog.panks.me/posts/2013/06/arch-linux-installation-with-os-x-on-macbook-air-dual-boot/>
                    
                        1.  other ones
                        
                            1.  <https://github.com/pandeiro/arch-on-air>
                            
                            2.  <http://codylittlewood.com/arch-linux-on-macbook-pro-installation/>
                            
                            3.  <https://vec.io/posts/use-arch-linux-and-xmonad-on-macbook-pro-with-retina-display>
                        
                        2.  the only mistake, IIRC, is that \`-C\` isn't a proper argument to \`grub-mkstandalone\`, as instead you should use whattever I can't recall it's referring to in the man page
                    
                    2.  checkout <https://github.com/jantman/puppet-archlinux-macbookretina> and <http://hn.premii.com/#/comments/8904213>
                    
                    3.  reinstalling arch <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_existing_Linux> and <http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/2wi1k1/id_like_to_point_out_the_arch_wiki_has_many_ways/>
                    
                    4.  this was helpful <https://vec.io/posts/use-arch-linux-and-xmonad-on-macbook-pro-with-retina-display>
                    
                    5.  THIS was what made me get through reinstalling <http://zanshin.net/2015/02/05/arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-part-3-base-installation/>
                    
                    6.  XXX make a note that can Terminal from Apple's perspective in HFS+ partition when rebooting with Cmd+r to do a net install!!!
                
                10. laptop power
                
                    1.  <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Power_management>
                
                11. lrn-dotfiles
                
                    1.  gnu stow <http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html>
                
                12. maintenance
                
                    1.  obviously, pay attention to your programs when \`pacman -Suy\`
                    
                    2.  \`pipelight\` is a special case, as it needs to be activated (see its entry under netflix) every time a new version is installed
                    
                    3.  haskell: run \`cabal update\` and \`cabal install world\` to update installed libs for haskell use
                    
                    4.  what is what is file "000033.log" in dropbox? how to search for that, find? is it emacs?
                
                13. microphone
                
                    1.  starting pulseaudio server and switching input in pavucontrol to analog seems to make mic work
                
                14. mime / xdg-open types
                
                    1.  installed 'mimeopen' package to be able to 'mimeopen -d file.pdf', then can set /usr/bin/okular to be the program, it works! with calibre and xdg-open and everything
                    
                    2.  use \`mimeopen -d <file>.<filetype> to CLI-set which specific program you want to use for that filetype
                    
                    3.  \`xdg-mime query default application/pdf\` to query program
                    
                    4.  \`xdg-mime query filetype file.pdf\` to query filetype
                    
                    5.  some applications appear to force their Mimetypes in a way that conflicts with even when you set it
                    
                        1.  check out \`grep 'application/pdf' /usr/share/applications/\*' to see which ones reset
                
                15. neovim
                
                    1.  got everything working (minus powerline, which appears to be a fundamental issue with vim's \`bindeval\`) by installing from yaourt \`neovim-git\` and \`python2-neovim-git\`
                
                16. netflix and az prime
                
                    1.  how I got netflix working on FIREFOX:
                    
                    2.  just to be careful, make sure you close all browsers before updating: <https://answers.launchpad.net/pipelight/+faq/2357>
                    
                    3.  write down that needed to activate multilib section of /etc/pacman.conf in order to install pipelight for netflix ANY way, since it was necessary for ANYTHING for wine, including most/all of it's lib32-x dependencies
                    
                        1.  this is done by uncommenting the \`[multilib]\` lines in \`/etc/pacman.conf\`
                    
                    4.  to make it easier, add pipelight to \`/etc/pacman.conf\`
                    
                        1.  do all of step 1 in <http://pipelight.net/cms/install/installation-arch-linux.html> to add the pipelight binary repos to your native pacman behavior
                    
                    5.  just to be safe do "sudo pipelight-plugin &#x2013;disable-all"
                    
                    6.  "sudo pipelight-plugin &#x2013;enable silverlight"", then accept the licenses (SUDO is important here)
                    
                        1.  note that enabling the plugin and accepting the licenses are currently needed every update
                    
                    7.  also did "sudo pipelight-plugin &#x2013;create-mozilla-plugins" but this may not be necessary
                    
                    8.  then get a user agent extension to firefox like the "UAControl 0.1.3.1" extension, giving it the user agent for netflix.com "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20120427 Firefox/15.0a1"
                    
                        1.  "chromium &#x2013;user-agent="derp" " doesn't seem to work anymore?
                    
                    9.  AZ prime
                    
                        1.  is different, uses flash but needs old proprietary stuff from the HAL package, so install \`hal\` from yaourt and run the script from <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Flash_DRM_content#Using_the_HAL_package>
                
                17. photo editing
                
                    1.  the GIMP, obviously, but \`mogrify()\` (and \`convert()\`) as part of imagemagick are awesome for commandline photo editing, like rotation of a bunch of files
                
                18. peripherals
                
                    1.  arch ipod
                    
                        1.  <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IPod#iPod_Classic.2FNano3g>
                        
                            1.  this worked! you can start by mounting like normal!
                            
                            2.  the only thing is that you need something that can read the database like \`gtkpod\`
                    
                    2.  compnet printer/printing
                    
                        1.  install \`cups\` and \`libcups\`
                        
                        2.  then, enable on boot via systemctl \`systemctl enable org.cups.cupsd.service\` and start \`systemctl start org.cups.cupsd.service\` a la <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1478928#p1478928> (previously, was just "systemctl start cups")
                        
                            1.  this is necessary for hp-setup to find the ppd file!
                        
                        3.  go to \`localhost:631\` in browser
                        
                        4.  install \`hplip\` that's lip not lib
                        
                        5.  run \`sudo hp-setup\`, probably have to run with -i interactive flag
                        
                        6.  try running \`hp-doctor\` if problems
                        
                        7.  this helped! <http://www.muktware.com/2013/04/how-to-install-and-configure-hp-printer-in-arch-linux/4192>
                
                19. pictures program
                
                    1.  use 'geeqie', dev'd fork of dead gqview?
                
                20. python
                
                    1.  even though there are some native python thingies, consider them OS USE ONLY, via deploying ALL python development use using virtualenv! see the philosophy here: <https://hynek.me/articles/virtualenv-lives/>
                    
                    2.  anaconda
                    
                        1.  to make "up arrow" and ctrl-p move up (and down, down) in the history, on Arch at least (bc Arch is using a newer libncurses?), must "conda install ncurses" as well into each environment <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/455>
                
                21. screenshot
                
                    1.  using imagemagick, which is probably already installed
                    
                        1.  run \`import -window root screenshot.jpg\` to save a screenshot to /home/USER
                    
                    2.  sometimes, opening the screenshots in certain image viewers, or the actual screenshot itself, will be screwed up, probably something to do with its headers &#x2013; in that case, basically just run \`mogrify -density 90 screenshot.jpg\` from <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/134911>
                
                22. skype
                
                    1.  okay, so you're going to need to switch your audio to PulseAudio (which, AFAIK, is headphones/speaker-sensitive and just as good/capable as native sound stuff.)
                    
                    2.  packages needed to be installed (from pacman):
                    
                        1.  multilib/skype
                        2.  extra/libcanberra-pulse (needed for pavucontrol)
                        3.  extra/libpulse (necessary, this'll probably already be installed due to chromium etc.)
                        4.  multilib/lib32-libpulse (specifically needed for skype?)
                        5.  extra/pavucontrol (maybe unnecessary, but acts as a good \`alsamixer\` for PulseAudio INCLUDING the fact that it shows the amplitude of the ACTUAL SIGNAL either being output or input, so you can see if you're getting any mic signal)
                        6.  extra/pulseaudio (needed for input processing and pavucontrol working correctly, aka it acts as a PulseAudio server?)
                        7.  extra/pulseaudio-alsa (optional, equalizes \`alsamixer\` behavior with the PulseAudio channels)
                    
                    3.  another thing: as per Solution 1 at <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/skype#Crackling.2Fnoisy_sound_.28mainly_using_64-bit_OS.29> , add \`PULSE<sub>LATENCY</sub><sub>MSEC</sub>=60\` to the beginning of the \`exec&#x2026;\` line in \`/usr/bin/skype\`. This is needed for the horrible crackling quality on both input and output.
                    
                    4.  lastly, you MAY need to go into either pavucontrol? or at least alsamixer and increase the input capture and Digital channels to nonzero
                    
                    5.  after this, you may not need to restart X or the computer, but do it anyways just to be sure. It should work at this point.
                    
                    6.  note: after restarting the computer, you will need to reenable PulseAudio using the simple \`pulseaudio &#x2013;start\`, after which you can use pavucontrol to control it
                
                23. spotify
                
                    1.  turn off notifications after v1: edit the config file seems to be the only way to work, even if just adding a line <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=206204>
                
                24. sound
                
                    1.  make sure to switch to PulseAudio using \`pulseaudio &#x2013;start\` on startup (see the skype section for install)
                    
                    2.  see skype section for how to setup pulseaudio
                    
                    3.  audacity doesn't like pulseaudio, use \`pulseaudio &#x2013;kill\`
                
                25. steam
                
                    1.  upon install:
                    
                        1.  1. install and run like usual, will download crap
                        
                        2.  2. alias steam to "STEAM<sub>RUNTIME</sub>=0 steam" <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/steam#Using_native_runtime>
                        
                        3.  3. will yell about missing dependencies, which, from link above, you can find by \`cd ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12<sub>32</sub> ; LD<sub>LIBRARY</sub><sub>PATH</sub>=".:${LD<sub>LIBRARY</sub><sub>PATH</sub>}" ldd $(file \*|sed '*ELF*!d;s/:.\*//g')|grep 'not found'|sort|uniq\`
                        
                        4.  4. use \`pkgfile\` to find which packages those specific .so files are from
                    
                    2.  archaic
                    
                        1.  VERSION<sub>ID</sub>="2015.11.01" in /etc/os-release from <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam/Troubleshooting#VERSION_ID:_unbound_variable>
                        
                        2.  temporarily downgrading to libgcrypt-1.6.5-1 from <https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/48994>
                        
                        3.  steam complains about no opengl direct rendering unless \`multilib/lib32-intel-dri\` is installed (a la <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1432335>) (and also probably \`multilib/lib32-mesa-libgl\`)
                
                26. system, incl X11 settings, package configs (including journal for manual changes to system)
                
                    1.  getting started
                    
                        1.  (unnecessary to actually have an \`xorg.conf\` in arch, but it's way better to have one)
                        
                        2.  make sure you install the \`xf86-video-intel\` or whatever it is, that's not explicitly mentioned in the arch Beg Guide
                        
                        3.  generate a skeleton via running \`Xorg :0 -configure\`
                        
                        4.  then sudo copy the new file \`/root/xorg.conf.new\` to \`/etc/X11/xorg.conf\`
                        
                            1.  not necessarily necessary, but do it
                        
                        5.  start it with \`startx\`, which uses \`~/.xinitrc\`
                    
                    2.  fonts
                    
                        1.  (as in, in xterm in X11)
                        
                        2.  add the fonts to \`/usr/share/fonts/<folder for whichever filetype they are, like TTF>\`
                        
                            1.  after this, they should be see/grep-able using \`fc-list\`, just to make sure
                        
                        3.  in \`.Xdefaults\` or whichever your WM is using, add
                        
                            \`\`\` XTerm\*faceName: PragmataPro:style=Regular XTerm\*faceSize: 10 \`\`\`
                    
                    3.  important files for X:
                    
                        1.  ~/.xinitrc (where you choose your wm)
                        
                        2.  ~/.Xdefaults
                        
                        3.  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
                        
                        4.  also see files listed in $lib/bash/rsync<sub>utils</sub>/maint/sync<sub>arch</sub><sub>system</sub><sub>files</sub>.sh
                    
                    4.  whoa \`xdg-open\` can be used on terminal or even dmenu with arguments to open in native app
                    
                        1.  you use \`xdg-mime\` to edit default applications
                        
                        2.  to open pdfs in firefox, for example, (see \`xdg-mime &#x2013;manual\`), use \`xdg-mime default firefox.desktop application/pdf\`
                        
                        3.  can maybe edit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list ? not sure
                        
                        4.  can use \`mimeopen -d <file>\` via xdg-open for interative mime default app selection on CLI! see <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open#perl-file-mimeinfo>
                    
                    5.  \`dmesg\` gets like the kernel cycle buffer or something? what even is that?
                    
                    6.  changing keyboard settings using xkboptions a la X11 (archaic)
                    
                        1.  can change any of these to default via \`setxkbmap -option\` by itself
                        
                        2.  swap capslock and control, like for laptop keyboard, with just \`setxkbmap -option "ctrl:swapcaps"\`
                        
                        3.  swap alt and windows keys, like for home keyboard with just \`setxkbmap -option "altwin:swap<sub>alt</sub><sub>win</sub>"\`
                        
                        4.  so, you may have to start by additionally installing the \`evdev\` general input (incl. keyboard and mouse) driver, idk
                        
                        5.  once done, enabling caps/ctrl swapping on startup is as easy as expressing an XkbOption in \`/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf\` like
                        
                            \`\`\` Section "InputClass" Identifier "evdev keyboard catchall" MatchIsKeyboard "on"
                            
                            
                            Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps" Driver "evdev" EndSection \`\`\`
                        
                        6.  as of 2014-12-10, have just started using "ctrl:nocaps" instead of messing with swapcaps for X11, and made new keymaps to fix both caps/ctrl switch and alt+arrow (alt+L/R arrows) console switching in non-X11 console via:
                    
                    7.  swapfile see <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/swap#Swap_file_creation>
                    
                        1.  this is from <http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/769644-hacking-your-linux-keyboard-with-xkb/>
                    
                    8.  2014-12-03: so apparently running "systemctl mask systemd-udev-settle" will disable that thing which was slowing down boot
                    
                        1.  this worked! briefly reading forums say that this settling thing isn't really used or at least is obsolete
                    
                    9.  visual framework settings (gtk, etc.)
                    
                        1.  qt, affecting konquerer, dolphin, vlc: run \`qtconfig-qt4\`
                        
                        2.  some others? \`gtk-chtheme\`
                    
                    10. apparently config files for lots of installed pacman packages are in "/usr/share/<program>/stuff.conf"
                    
                    11. CLI X11 display scripting \`DISPLAY=:0.0 .screenlayout/laptop.sh\`
                    
                    12. \`xprop\` run through terminal allows you to click on a program running in X11 and see its properties?
                    
                    13. use \`xev\` to find keycodes
                    
                    14. 
                
                27. lrn-thinkpad-specific
                
                    1.  <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Thinkpad_T450s>
                    
                    2.  thinkpad wireless notes
                    
                        1.  after uninstalling all netctl, networkmanager, wpa stuff, etc. etc.
                        
                        2.  just doing \`ip link set wlp3s0 up\` gives \`ipv6: addrconf(netdev<sub>up</sub>): wlp3s0: link is not ready\`, though doing \`ip link\` seems to suggest it is up after all
                    
                    3.  apparently \`tp<sub>smapi\`</sub> doesn't work for newer processors like mine <http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tp_smapi> suggests to use thinkpad<sub>acpi</sub> instead
                
                28. time
                
                    1.  change timezone by \`timedatectl set-timezone america/new<sub>york\`</sub> or america/chicago etc.
                
                29. trackpad
                
                    1.  dl "mtrack" driver
                    2.  add either the section or just the preferences here to /etc/x11/xorg.conf: \`\`\` \\### aes: some of these settings are new/nondefault, and this entire section might be as well section "inputclass" matchistouchpad "on" identifier "touchpads" option "thumbsize" "50" option "scrolldistance" "80" option "sensitivity" "0.5" option "fingerhigh" "9" driver "mtrack" endsection \`\`\`
                    
                    1.  as of 2014<sub>07</sub><sub>30</sub>, new update to xorg-server 1.16, having that stuff in the \`xorg.conf\` was sufficient to completely disable the trackpad!
                    
                        1.  however, deleting then reinstalling the mtrack driver through yaourt and adding in 10-mtrack.conf to xorg.conf.d didn't have any effects
                    
                    2.  so adding these settings into 10-mtrack.conf makes it seem like they're working!
                    
                    3.  ugh so on 2014-08-21, seemingly upgraded xorg, andt disabled touchpad, though it was an easy fix since \`/etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\` suddenly was demoted to just a backup with \`.pacsave\`. by copying the pacsave to the file's name before, it now works! ugh, i don't want to have to do this every time!
                
                30. urxvt
                
                    1.  transparency in xmonad through compositing
                    
                        1.  enable composite in /etc/x11/xorg.conf through \`\`\` section "extensions" option "composite" "enable" endsection \`\`\`
                        2.  dl prog \`xcompmgr\`, and in your \`~/.xinitrc\`, put (maybe needs to be before exec monad) \`xcompmgr -c &\`
                        3.  if want background picture, program \`feh\` seems to work better than program \`xloadimage\`
                
                31. vnc
                
                    1.  apparently i'm using \`vncviewer\` which is really \`aur/tigervnc-viewer\` but may come with default vnc package?
                
                32. webcam
                
                    1.  package 'isight-firmware-tools' or something like it from aur, and then reboot of computer, seems to fix nonfunctioning webcam on air
                
                33. window managers
                
                    1.  i3 when using in kde
                    
                        1.  <https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2939/i3wm-and-kde-together/> (kde sys settings) and <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21617087> (environment vbl) for 2 diffferent methods
                    
                    2.  xmobar and xmonad
                    
                        1.  maybe better than pacman to just do clean cabal-install of xmonad and xmonad-contrib?
                        
                        2.  so, necessary and sufficient to use these by installing via pacman \`xmonad\`, \`xmobar\`, and \`xmonad-contrib\` (the latter are important for customization of xmonad.hs)
                        
                            1.  you may also need to use the cabal builder to build the \`xmonad\` and \`xmobar\` programs
                        
                        3.  the xmonad mod4 key bug was solved upon exiting spotify for some reason

                    1.  NetworkManager
                    
                        1.  to save wifi passwords, go to 'nm-connection-editor', right click on people next to password and "store password for all users"
                    
                    2.  bu / general wpa wireless support
                    
                        1.  use \`wpa<sub>supplicant</sub>.conf\` example in \`z wpa<sub>supplicant\`</sub> entry in the db
                        
                            \`\`\` fast<sub>reauth</sub>=0 network={ ssid="bu (802.1x)" priority=15 key<sub>mgmt</sub>=wpa-eap eap=peap mschapv2 identity="user" password="derp" phase2="auth=mschapv2" } \`\`\`
                    
                    3.  autoswitch
                    
                        1.  need \`wpa<sub>actiond\`</sub> for wireless switching and \`ifplugd\` for wired switching, as per <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/netctl#automatic_operation>
                        
                        2.  you then add auto daemons via \`netctl-ifplugd@<interface>.service\` for wired and \`netctl-auto@<interface>.service\` for wireless
                    
                    4.  troubleshooting wireless network
                    
                        1.  first set up the interface with \`sudo ip link set wlp2s0 up\`
                        
                        2.  then do the handshake via \`sudo wpa<sub>supplicant</sub> -b -dwext -iwlp2s0 -c/etc/wpa<sub>supplicant</sub>/wpa<sub>supplicant</sub>.conf\`
                        
                        3.  then get a dhcp lease via \`sudo dhcpcd wlp2s0\`
                        
                        4.  finally, ping to test \`ping -c 2 www.google.com\`
                    
                    5.  oh my god, don't even get me started. <http://andym3.wordpress.com/projects/the-broadcom-wireless-card-guide/>
                    
                    6.  as of 2014<sub>06</sub><sub>01</sub>, now i need to load module \`brcmsmac\` with \`modprobe brcmsmac\` after booting in order to load the wireless interface, after which everything is peachy
                    
                    7.  as of 2014<sub>06</sub><sub>19</sub>, everything is back in order, the normal interface wlp2s0 loads on boot, and it works.
                    
                        1.  the issue was, while something did go wrong a while back, i def made things worse by blacklisting pretty much all available broadcom wireless drivers in \`/usr/lib/modprobe/broadcom-wl.conf\`
                        
                        2.  the proper place to blacklist things, as per <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_modules#blacklisting> , is in a \`/etc/modprobe.d/<modprobe|blacklist>.conf\` file where you just put an entry for \`blacklist <module name>\`
                        
                        3.  as per looking at the actual module being used by the hardware, \`lspci -vnn | grep -7 14e4\` tells us that now, the \`bcma\` module is the one being used
                        
                            1.  this is good, since this appears to be the default one, as it's one of the few that are already loaded in the kernel.
                        
                        4.  so in other words, if it breaks again, do another \`lspci&#x2026;\` to see if bcma is not being used, etc. note that \`brcmsmac\` relies on \`bcma\`, which apparently can still be loaded if blacklisted if you do \`sudo modprobe brcmsmac\`
                        
                        5.  you can see the status of some? modules via \`lsmod\`, and you can see where all the modules are loaded from via \`mkinitcpio -v | less\`
                    
                    8.  as of 2014<sub>07</sub><sub>29</sub>, there was a kernel upgrade and now broadcom-wl module doesn't appear to work, so had to modprobe brcmsmac to get working again. since wl automatically blacklists brcmsmac, i uninstalled wl from yaourt, and upon reboot brcmsmac starts automatically and works. so will delay getting broadcom-wl for a while. wow i actually knew what to do at this point.
                    
                    9.  seems you need to manually reenable/etc netctl profiles via \`sudo netctl enable/start/reenable wlp2s0-derp\` before you can enable them in netctl-auto

                In terms of privacy, even a non-free non-open-source local app with DRM or license management is better than a server app with a "strict privacy policy". With a good firewall setup, you can be pretty sure that the local app won't betray you.

                1.  (woodfield 1979) 25% incr in reqr complexity => 100% incr in soln complexity
                
                    1.  this also means you should cut down on reqr
                
                2.  (van genuchten 1991) two biggest causes of project failure are
                
                    1.  1. poor estimation

                3.  (thomas 1997) if more than 20-25% of a component needs revision, it's better to rewrite it from scratch

            6.  how to install new latex classes, under texlive on \*nix:
            
                1.  if have class file e.g. 'pnastwo.cls', put it in '$home/texmf/tex/latex/pnastwo' like in the above link
                2.  then run 'texhash ~/texmf' to index/whatever it (like mentioned in <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/130082>), then you should be done! and can call the the class in tex across your filesystem
                
                1.  deploying new stylesheet: just put \`#+latex<sub>class</sub>: pnastwo\` at the top of the doc, and will automatically make it look much prettier (including smaller font)

                    2.  once 12k, split into indiv mutual funds
                    
                    3.  now is good time to buy 20150911 esp intl
                    
                    4.  definitely don't put in more than max, or withdraw (obvi)
                    
                    5.  if more, "invest in a vanguard taxable accoutn", "something like vsivx, since doesn't pay much in dividends, and is therefore tax efficient" - "just builds equity which you don't get taxed on until later, and laxed at lt cap gains, which is much more favourable"
                
                5.  more
                
                    1.  firstly, find low fee mutual fund company in planning on 2040/50 retirement via roth ira and roth 401k
                    
                    2.  max out roth ira (or roth 401k if so chosen) ($5500/yr) ****first****, super important in 20s
                    
                    3.  then do vanguard "small cap value fund" and "total stock market index fund" ticket visvx, vtsax
                    
                    4.  then open tax deferred life insurance policy

                    Recall that the power spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Power_spectral_density> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%E2%80%93Khinchin_theorem>
                    
                    The autocorrelation function describes the second moment (variance) of a wide-sense stationary stochastic process: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process#Weak_or_wide-sense_stationarity>
                    
                    Hence the power spectrum is a frequency-domain decomposition of the time-domain variance of the process. Note that this only makes sense if you're treating the signal as a stochastic process, rather than a deterministic signal. Pretty much all spectral analysis of neural data (at least implicitly) models the signal (possibly windowed) as a wide-sense stationary process.
                    
                    This is also why you need to remove the DC component (mean across time) before calculating the power spectrum: the mean across time is the first moment, which is assumed to be constant.

            1.  20140224-adult education cajun cooking class
            
                -   cajun roux
                    -   darker so more flavor and color, less when formal
                    -   used as a french thickening agent
                    -   low heat!
                -   jambalaya - rice dish with stuff, while gumbo is a stew w/ rice in it
                    -   "red" jambalaya - tomato
                    -   uncooked rice (he did 3 cups to 5c stock and large tomato sauce)
                    -   you can bake jambalaya
                -   shrimp remoulade - "remolaude" means condiment
                -   cajun "trinity" - celery, green chilis, pepper
                    -   "holy trinity" - trinity + garlic
                -   okra - word originally "okigumbo" but now gumbo
                    -   use it in gumbo!
                -   his greatgrandma used tomatoes in gumbo
                -   if you "move around" the chx, it'll break apart, so make the call
                -   Andouille sausage
                    -   can you get good stuff even at supermarket now, since it's a thing
                -   diagonal cuts of jalapeno are quicker
                -   poaching liquid - lots of lemon, celery, white wine
                -   15 mins on softening his vegs - until the color starts to dull
                -   add lemon to remoulade stuff (and many other things)
                -   "crystal" hot sauce, less vinegary
                -   poach just a few shrimp at a time, since some will chamge temp too much to be effectual
                    -   don't want rubber overcooked, get "just at or undercooked"
                    -   look at the head of the spine to check if center underdone
                    -   shock the shrimp
                -   cajuns use animal fat in roux, Creole used butter and were richer, it's more traditionally French, simpler (less ingredients), more finely differentiated
                -   hoppier beer: drink it sooner
                -   incr alc = it ages better / you can wait on it
                -   Ommegang, Allagash, and Cambr Brew Comp have "wild yeast" beers
                -   CBC is isolating Cambridge "urban" natural yeast
                -   "GumboTales" book

                5.  ribs: Remove silver skin, wash with water and pat super dry. Apply dry rub (your choice, but ground mustard, chili powder, onion/garlic powder, salt/pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, little cinnamon and cumin is Kat's go-to). Massage the shit out of your ribs with rub. Flip upside down so ribs cook in their own juices. Cook at 300F for 3 hrs. Remove from oven, flip and baste in BBQ sauce (again, your choice or make your own &#x2013; Kat does apple cider vinegar, reduced sugar ketchup, whole grain mustard, small amount of honey, worchestire, spices as needed). Crank up to 375. Baste every 10 min for about 30 min. Takes 3.5-4 hrs depending on size of rack. These always fall off the bone.

                    WARNING THIS IS THE BEST CHILI YOU WILL EVER TASTE, DON'T DIE AFTER EATING Grocery List 1 - 2 lb of a Boneless Beef Chuck cubed. (no g/b or cubed steak) 1 Large Container Beef Stock 1 large red onion 1 Yellow Onion 1 Stalk of Celery 1 Beer I like to use Blue Moon 1 pack of Thick Cut Bacon 1 Large Bag of Pinto Beans DRY (This is secret #1) 1 Small Bag Black Beans DRY ( Dry Beans all together are secret #1) 1 Large Garlic Clove 1 Red Bell pepper 2 Cans Stewed Tomatoes with Green Chili's Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Butter Small Can of Tomato Paste Cheddar Cheese and Oyster Crackers (Optional) Spices Assorted Spices, Cumin, Chili Powder, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Paprika, Oregano, Salt, Pepper. Fridge Staples Worcestershire Sauce Ketchup (Secret #2) Vinegar Hot Sauce/Tabasco Liquid Smoke Preperation. Soak Dry Beans Overnight, If you don't soak overnight, Soak at least one hour prior to cooking. Cover Beans with Water, Chop Yellow onion in half, and chop celery 2 celery stalks in half. Add the Halved onion's and celery to the water/dry bean mixture, Boil beans Until Almost soft and when the water level is low Add 1/2 of your beef stock/broth. Continue boiling until fully cooked, You will have a soupy bean/beef/veg broth just covering the top of the beans. Remove the 2 onion halves and the celery stalks. Dice your entire red Onion, and red bell Pepper, and Mince your garlic. Start a hot pan with EVOO and 1tbs Butter. Add the Bacon, Once partially cooked, Add Diced Chuck, Cook until the outsides are seared, add The entire onion and red bell pepper, saute until translucent and sweet, add minced garlic and cook for 20-30 seconds more. This whole process shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. Add the rest of the Beef Broth to the beans and your Beer, Add the Beef/Bacon/Onion/RBP/Garlic Mixture to the Pot as well. Also add Both cans of Stewed tomatoes. Add about 1tbs of each seasoning, except oregano, add 1tsp oregano. Be very liberal with the worcestershire, add lots. Add 2 tsp vinegar, 2 tsp hot sauce and 1tbs liquid smoke. And Add Several TBS of Ketchup, this is my secret. It brings tons of flavor profile to the table. Also Add A tbs or so of tomato paste if you like thicker chili. Simmer this for at least an hour stirring occasionally. Serve with Diced onions, Cheddar Cheese and Oyster crackers if you please. NEVER MAKE CHILIS WITH CANNED BEANS YOU DISGUST ME!!! Options: Add a tbs of mustard, Add large Carrots or other larger portion vegetable in the bean boiling process for additional veg broth flavor. Add more spices for your particular flavor profile. Add red pepper flake for heat, Add Fresh diced jalapeno's in the sauteing process.

                    Early in my career, I asked that question. Eventually I got some answers.
                    
                    Broadly usually the 'big bucks' are in things that are new at least in some important sense. To find such things, one recommended approach is to stand "on the shoulders of giants". Then you may still do some original work, but you have one heck of a base. My view is that Moore's law, the Internet, etc. are not nearly fully exploited, that enormous value remains, and the best way to get some of this value is to find a big unsolved problem where a good solution will be very valuable, stand on the shoulders of some giants, do some original work to get some powerful 'secret sauce' for solving the problem (which appears not to be easy to solve otherwise), start a business, please customers, get revenue, grow the business and sell it.
                    
                    Here, however, just what problem, giants, original work, secret sauce are NOT easy to see. Broadly we are trying to see, no, MAKE, the future, and usually that is not easy. While we can see what applications have been made of statistics in the past, what statistics will be applied where in the future is not easy to see.
                    
                    Yes, broadly statistics is highly promising. Or, in 'information technology' we want valuable, new information, are awash in cycles, bytes, bandwidth, infrastructure software, and data, and want to use these to create the information. Here, on appropriate problems, statistics can commonly, easily, totally 'blow away' anything else. The marriage between (A) 'information technology' in business and (B) statistics has yet to be consummated, even to reach to 'going steady' stage, assuming the traditional order of events.
                    
                    For 100 years or so, people have come to statistics from various areas of work. Usually they had some data and some questions. Some of the areas have been educational and psychological testing, experiments and testing in agriculture and medicine, industrial quality control, model building in economics, experimental work in physics and chemistry, investing, attempts to create mathematically based sciences in the social sciences, especially economics, psychology, sociology, and political science. In sociology, old examples would be James Coleman, Pete Rossi (professors of my wife when she got her Ph.D.), Leo Goodman.
                    
                    Likely the best fast, practical path into statistics is via books, courses, etc. intended for students in the social sciences. These students commonly do not have good backgrounds in mathematics. For the mathematical prerequisites, generally can get by, as a start, with just high school first year algebra. With this path can learn about probability distributions, the central limit theorem, the law of large numbers, statistical estimation and confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, cross tabulation, analysis of variance, regression analysis, principle components analysis, and more.
                    
                    For more, statistics is a rock solid part of mathematics, as solid as any part of pure mathematics, e.g., topology, geometry, analysis, algebra, etc. That is, statistics is based solidly on theorems and proofs, sometimes relatively deep ones.
                    
                    Statistics as theorems and proofs is called 'mathematical statistics'. Long standard has been (with TeX markup):
                    
                    Alexander M.\\ Mood, Franklin A.\\ Graybill, and Duane C.\\ Boas, {\it Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, Third Edition,\\/} McGraw-Hill, New York.\\ \\
                    
                    The main prerequisite for this book is just a not very good course in calculus, and the book actually makes not much use of calculus. Mostly all a student will need from calculus is that it can find the area under a curve. Since the book has long been standard, can't really ignore it, but it's ugly. And often, with just calculus, the book doesn't really give solid proofs of the results. E.g., their treatment of sufficient statistics has some nice intuition, but their proof is junk. The subject cries out for a good book, but I'm not trying to write one or waiting for someone else to.
                    
                    Can get some of the flavor of mathematical statistics done with high quality, as mathematics, in, say (with TeX markup):

                    However, pursued mathematically, statistics has some relatively advanced prerequisites some of which curiously are not popular in US university mathematics departments.
                    
                    For the prerequisites,
                    
                    High School. Should have had high school first and second year algebra (reasonable facility with algebraic manipulations, the binomial theorem, complex numbers, both of which will see again in important ways), plane geometry (where nearly all the work was proofs &#x2013; first place to learn about proofs), trigonometry (usually assumed in calculus and important in, say, analysis of organ tone harmonics and, thus, the most important example of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space), analytic geometry (especially the conic sections, especially ellipses which definitely will see again), and, if can, solid geometry (for more intuition in three dimensions).
                    
                    College. Need a standard calculus course, not necessarily a very comprehensive or difficult one because will do the subject all over again, maybe two or three times, and more later, WITH the proofs!
                    
                    Then need linear algebra, that is, how to work with data of several dimensions, which is just crucial. The big result is the polar decomposition, and there get to think about ellipses and get to use complex numbers. Also the course is an introduction to functional analysis and Hilbert space. Use any popular book to get started but in the end cover the classic, Halmos, "Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces'. Halmos wrote this when he was an assistant to von Neumann and intended it to be a finite dimensional introduction to Hilbert space (which once von Neumann had to explain to Hilbert) which it is. It also has some multi-linear algebra, of interest to exterior algebra now popular in relativity, but likely for nearly any business applications of statistics for the next several decades can skip that chapter.
                    
                    Then need some advanced calculus. That is a poorly organized, huge, catch-all subject beyond any one course. The usual start is 'baby' Rudin, 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis'. So, that's calculus with the proofs. Warning: The book is severe, succinct, with zero pictures. Have to draw your own pictures in your head. The book is packed solidly with powerful material just awash in important applications from statistics, economics, and engineering to physics, but there is hardly a hint of the applications in the book. I enjoyed the book, but few people will enjoy it or even get through it. Hint: Get a really good teacher! Then for more, popular is Spivak, 'Calculus on Manifolds', mostly because it is short. Actually, it's too short. I prefer Fleming, 'Functions of Several Variables' until get to the exterior algebra chapter at which time, if care, can now get the thin
                    
                    Henri Cartan, {\it Differential Forms,\\/} ISBN 0-486-45010-4, Dover, Mineola, NY, 2006.\\ \\
                    
                    in English.
                    
                    Between Halmos, baby Rudin, and Spivak, you will have covered Harvard's Math 55 with a colorful description at
                    
                    <http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-co>&#x2026;
                    
                    Harvard tries to cover these three for freshman, but in most math departments the material will take you through all or nearly all of a focused undergraduate pure math major.
                    
                    If somewhere take a course in abstract algebra, e.g., with a little group theory, then that might help!
                    
                    Graduate School. Might learn a little more about topology, say, from Simmons, 'Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis'. So, get good with metric spaces and get started on duality.
                    
                    The next big step is a course in measure theory and functional analysis. The Simmons work will help. Baby Rudin will be crucial; Halmos is recommended. So, with measure theory, do calculus over again and in a very different and much more powerful way and a way just crucial, even central, for mathematical approaches to statistics. The functional analysis will concentrate on representation theorems, the Radon-Nikodym theorem, and Hilbert and Banach spaces. Long popular, from Stanford and sometimes aimed at statistics students, is Royden, 'Real Analysis'. It's gorgeous. Should also read the real half of Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis'; it's a few steps up in difficulty from baby Rudin. Again, hint: Get a good course from a good teacher who can get you over the material without getting stuck. Then go back and study the material 2-3 more times, apply it, do some original research in it, and finally begin to understand it.
                    
                    We're talking high, top, center crown jewels of civilization here; the stuff is of just awesome power; my view is that it is, for the rest of this century, one of the main pillars of increases in economic productivity via the exploitation of Moore's law; on 'what to program', computer science is stuck and this material is the most promising way forward; as a famous restaurant owner once said about some Morey St. Denis, "you won't find better".
                    
                    Now are ready for probability. I recommend:
                    
                    Leo Breiman, {\it Probability,\\/} ISBN 0-89871-296-3, SIAM, Philadelphia.\\ \\
                    
                    M.\\ Lo\\\`eve, {\it Probability Theory, I and II, 4th Edition,\\/} Springer-Verlag, New York.\\ \\
                    
                    Kai Lai Chung, {\it A Course in Probability Theory, Second Edition,\\/} ISBN 0-12-174650-X, Academic Press, New York.\\ \\
                    
                    Jacques Neveu, {\it Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of Probability,\\/} Holden-Day, San Francisco.\\ \\
                    
                    Neveu is succinct, gorgeous, but not easy. This material is NOT popular in US departments of mathematics. At Princeton, see Cinlar.
                    
                    Then should make some progress with stochastic processes: The big book is Gihman and and Skorohod, right, in three volumes, but mostly people settle for shorter treatments. Whatever, should learn about Poisson processes, Markov processes (discrete time, finite state space is enough to get started), Brownian motion, and martingales. Might also learn about second order stationary processes. A good course in stochastic processes is NOT easy to find, especially in mathematics departments.
                    
                    Now are ready to attack statistics mathematically! I don't know of a good, single 'mathematical statistics' book at this level. Instead, there are many books &#x2013; I gave some above &#x2013; and then the journals. Thankfully, the field is relatively close to applications; so can take a practical problem and concentrate on what is relevant to it. One of my papers was some new work, at this level, in mathematical statistics for a problem in practical computing and computer science. The computer science community struggled terribly with the mathematics. So, it was some progress in computer science that community will have to struggle to understand.
                    
                    One approach to work in computing is just to try things, that is, just to throw things against the wall and see if they appear to stick. Or, maybe the truth of the situation really is a simple statistical model. Likely that model will fit the data well. So, try many simple statistical models. We use these models mostly ignoring the mathematical assumptions; mostly we are proceeding 'heuristically', that is, with guessing. If any of the models fit well, then they can be considered candidates for the truth. So, are throwing things against the wall to see if they fit. This approach also called 'data mining'.
                    
                    Problems:
                    
                    (1) Will be quite limited in what statistical models can use. That is, will be drawing from a cookbook instead of being a real chef who can create good, new dishes appropriate for the available ingredients and customers!
                    
                    (2) Don't have much, e.g., have not proceeded mathematically where from the deductive logic of assumptions and proofs actually know in advance some good things about the results. Something like breaking into a pharmacy, mixing up a lot of pills, taking them, and seeing if feel better! Uh, I'll pass and let you do that without me!
                    
                    (3) May have gone through a lot of computer time in an 'exponential, combinatorial explosion' of efforts throwing against the wall.
                    
                    (4) Have ignored a LOT in statistics that can add to what know about the results.
                    
                    (5) Will be tempted to conclude have have found 'causality' but will likely not have.
                    
                    (6) Will be tempted to conclude that have a model that predicts, but that is on shaky ground and risky and needs more work.
                    
                    Applied to important problems, this approach can be dangerous.
                    
                    There are not many healthy statistics departments. Much of the career interest is in biostatistics, especially related to FDA rules.
                    
                    It appears that among the top statistics departments are Berkeley and UNC. Since Breiman and Brillinger are at Berkeley and since Stanford, long good in statistics, is not far away, if I were looking for a Ph.D. in statistics then I'd pick Berkeley.
                    
                    There is a general problem getting a 'job' in a technical field and likely also with statistics. The assumption in US business is still as in factories 150 years ago: The supervisor knows more than the subordinate; the subordinate is supposed just to add common labor to what the supervisor says. In particular job descriptions are written by the supervisors, not the subordinates!
                    
                    Well, there are nearly no supervisors in US business who have even as much as a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about the material described here. So, won't need that material to qualify for the job descriptions. Moreover, if actually know such material and let that fact leak out, then will likely not make it past the first level HR English major phone screen person who will tremble and conclude that you are not like the employees they have! If you do get hired and someone in your management chain discovers that you have used some mathematics they don't understand, you might be on the way out the door, especially is your work was valuable for the company!
                    
                    Of course, the solution is to find a valuable application and start your own business. While maybe biomedical venture capital can understand crucial, core technical content, in information technology venture capital, likely you will be trying to explain this stuff to, say, history majors who worked in fund raising, marketing, general management, or financial analysis or have a background in just relatively elementary parts of computing. Just will NOT find more than six people, maybe not more than zero people, in US venture capital who can work the exercises in Royden or explain the strong law of large numbers. Sorry 'bout that! So, if you explain that the value of your venture is the powerful material in your 'secret sauce', then you will be regarded as a kook, far outside the mainstream of venture funded entrepreneurs, discarded, maybe even laughed at. As it is, some of the venture people are making money now, and the rest just want to be more like the ones who are making money. Looking for anything really new, powerful, and valuable is just NOT in the picture.
                    
                    So, once you have some results in users, customers, revenue, etc., then maybe you can get some venture funding; just why at that point, owning 100% of the business, you would take venture funding, a Board that can fire you, etc. is less clear! Or venture funding is not for everyone! Or venture firms prefer to give money to people who don't need it!
                    
                    For the real power of the 'secret sauce', you have just to keep that a secret!
                    
                    Once mathematicians have yachts, at the venture firms math will be to info tech like biochem is to biotech. In the meanwhile note that a valuable application of statistics can put you on the Forbes 400 where there are not many people! Generally if you are making a valuable application of advanced or new statistics, then you will not know many people who understand what you are doing. Or, if lots of people understood it, then it wouldn't be valuable!

            1.  h is not so much an inactivation variable (i.e. level of inactivation) as much as a DE-inactivation variable (where completely inactivated is 0 NOT 1!!!!!)
            
                1.  "Recall that h is the probability that a Na channel is NOT inactivated", p. 49, Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes
                
                2.  another way of thinking: h is prob that the "inactivation gate" is OPEN, allowing current to flow &#x2013; so if it's 0, then the gate is closed
                
                3.  NOT inactivated = the inactivation gate is OPEN, omg

                -   also I think there's a paper from 2003, with Friston and Breakspear as two of the authors, I can't remember the journal
                -   a very recent one (that I haven't read) is Hellyer et al., J Neuroscience, 2014 (Vol. 34, Issue 2)

                    3.  (Chen 2006, p. 3874) says "In thalamocortical neurons, HCN1 is barely detectable and the slower HCN2 and HCN4 isoforms predominate (Notomi and Shigemoto 2004; Santoro et al. 2000) with the majority of the current (80 –90%) attributed to HCN2 (Ludwig et al. 2003)."

                1.  we put things off thinking that we will have fun in the meantime, but usually it's guilt instead, a paralyzing emotion
                
                2.  we put things off by cooking, cleaning, other work things, things that have a "moral" component of "well look i'm doing this thing"
                
                3.  what we THINK we understand about procrastination is not actually true, but we still think these things in everyday exp:
                
                    1.  we think it's about having fun (it's not)
                    
                    2.  we think we're not affecting our future self (we are)
                    
                    3.  it's all about giving in to feel good (it's not)
                
                4.  "tomorrow is a mystical land where 98% of human productivity is stored"
                
                5.  one new defn of procr is "the gap b/w intention and action"
                
                6.  procr is a subset of delay, "all procr is delay, but not all delay is procr"
                
                    1.  example: if you plan to do hw for friday on thurs, that's not procr. If you get to thur and decide you don't "feel" like doing it, that's procr
                    
                    2.  voluntary, irrational delay
                
                7.  xxx [therefore, an important part of deciding BETWEEN delay and procr is planning!]
                
                8.  grad students esp feel this badly because there is much they need to and SHOULD delay, but they equate that with procr in their heads!!!
                
                9.  procr doesn't just affect performance, but also well-being, health, relationships, etc.
                
                    1.  procrastinating students are actually sick more
                
                10. think about how procr directly affects spending time with others
                
                    1.  and how the stress you get from it spreads to other people like a disease
                
                11. regrets of people bereaving those close to them who'd died is basically procr
                
                12. fixing it
                
                    1.  thinking about your agency
                    
                    2.  the most precious thing you have is time
                
                13. procr is "NOT a time-management issue", a planner does NOT help
                
                    1.  procrs tell time just like normies (study done by one of his students)
                    
                    2.  another of his students studied if procrs suffer the "planning fallacy" where they plan they're going to do a TON and then don't live up to it
                    
                        1.  procrs did NOT suffer planning fallacy (difference between expected and real understanding of how much studying they'd done)
                        
                        2.  procrs did study less and study later, but completely understood that they had done this
                
                14. it is NOT an issue with planning
                
                    1.  lots of people do their planning, but don't plan what they're going to do right now
                
                15. he gave an example of a meeting with a student after which he knew the student didn't keep working for the rest of the time that day
                
                16. xxx need to keep working AFTER successful meeting, use those good feelings for productivity
                
                17. he says he never procrs anymore since he UNDERSTANDS the self deception
                
                18. part of his understanding is of how actually long (and not that long) it takes himself to do something
                
                19. just writing out a plan relieves stress, but does NOT solve the issue!!
                
                20. procr is "weakness of will" and exerting self-control
                
                    1.  the more you say "well I'll just do this thing that only takes 2 minutes", you're still facing the same hard decision and willpower threshold 2 minutes later
                    
                    2.  in that moment, you're either going to work or not work
                    
                    3.  "at its heart, it's about weakness of will, and about self-regulation"
                    
                    4.  it's a self-regulation failure, like buying things you don't need or eating things you don't need to eat
                    
                    5.  xxx it's about willpower
                    
                    6.  "I want to feel good now"
                    
                    7.  esp with a thesis, when you get it back and it's not perfect/has lots of edits to do, you feel bad! [and that's okay] you get negative reinforcement (emotionally)
                    
                    8.  "negative reinforcement" is the removal of a negative stimulus, like using an umbrella
                    
                        1.  "procr is neg reinforcement", since the task makes you uncomfortable, therefore you're avoiding the task (to avoid the neg stim)
                        
                        2.  xxx therefore, by USING procr, you're REINFORCING that it's effective
                        
                        3.  it's a reinforced habit, and is difficult to change
                    
                    9.  [i originally was planning to talk to therapist about lack of "energy" of me doing things, but what if the real issue isn't energy but willpower? what if it's nto that i'm tired (although that does happen, but less frequently and a nap cures it), but it's self control and not enough willpower to work?]
                    
                        1.  the real issue may not be that i'm tired, but that I'm UNWILLING
                        
                        2.  listening to this discussion esp about personality and impulsivity, sounds like to work on solving this procr, i need to better understand the psych report and my personality
                
                21. there are multiple parts of this "self-regulation failure" - how do you intervene in these?
                
                    1.  personality
                    
                        1.  how to intervene
                        
                            1.  dutiful, self-disciplined people don't procr much
                            
                            2.  low "conscientiousness" (wishing to do a task correctly and thoroughly) means procr
                            
                            3.  high "impulsivity" means procr
                            
                                1.  "they can't shield one intention from another intention"
                            
                            4.  perfectionism
                            
                                1.  difference b/w self-perfectionists vs socially-prescribed perfectionism (driven by other people)
                                
                                    1.  the socially-prescribed perfectionists live up to OTHER people's standards, have lots of negative internal talk, and score high with procr
                                
                                2.  "perfectionism isn't bad, it depends on the flavor"
                            
                            5.  emotional intelligence
                            
                                1.  higher emo intel, lower procr
                                
                                2.  it's a skill that you CAN learn
                                
                                3.  "I said i was gonna do this, it doesn't matter how i feel"
                                
                                4.  task: just track how you feel about doing different things and write it down
                                
                                5.  neuroticism is emotional instability
                                
                                    1.  those who're neurotic have emo rxns to work that are WAY out of proportion, low lows and high highs, even when the work is NOT A BIG DEAL
                                
                                6.  procr will stay up all night, do task, turn it in, feel great, but then not use that good feeling to do more work
                                
                                    1.  real learning should be constant (at lower magnitude), not stop and go with cramming and then unworking
                                
                                7.  you have to learn to USE your emotions but also not react to neg emotions
                                
                                8.  "You can have fear but you do not need to BE your fear" (fear is the mind killer&#x2026;incl how it applies to learning!)
                            
                            6.  procr is also a developmental thing
                            
                                1.  PFC is last brain part in dev
                                
                                2.  if you've "achieved" your identity, less likely to procr
                                
                                3.  "you can't expect an 18 yo to act like a 25yo"
                        
                        2.  lots of personality traits are inherited???
                    
                    2.  the nature of the goals
                    
                        1.  how to intervene
                        
                        2.  task aversiveness
                        
                            1.  what makes a task aversive?
                            
                                1.  splitting a task into inception, planning, and action phases,
                                
                                2.  boredom/frustration at every stage
                                
                                3.  frustration at inception and planning phases = due to lack of meaning/enjoyment/(importance?)
                                
                                4.  frustration at action phase = due to lack of structure/control/uncertainy
                            
                            2.  temporal construal theory = are you thinking abstractly or concretely, and how that affects our temporal interpretation
                            
                                1.  "when you think about things concretely, you think of them in terms of today, but abstractly, tomorrow" (recent psych result)
                                
                                2.  so it's not jsut breaking things down into baby steps, but the fact you're thinking about real world actions, which makes your brain give the things more urgency
                        
                        3.  how we think about the task
                        
                            1.  "I work better without pressure" fallacy aka the "arousal procr"
                            
                            2.  quote from thesis "The mental discipline necessary to work towards a deadline is something that you must develop. It can become a habit just as lettings things slide until the last minute can become a habit. That pattern leads to staying up all night and writing in a blind panic. Besides ruining your health, you never can write your best. If anyone tells you "I have to wait until the pressure is on before I can start to cook", don't believe it. Occasionally, you may be able to work under pressure of a deadline, but stop kidding yourself, it won't be your best."
                            
                            3.  uh make deadlines
                            
                            4.  several quotes from music industry people about how you THINK you'd work better under pressure, but that's not true and not how it works
                            
                            5.  procrs think "it could have been worse", but that's just making an excuse (and you're always going to be able to say that to yourself, but it's never helpful)
                    
                    3.  self-control and willpower
                    
                        1.  how to intervene
                        
                        2.  willpower is like a muscle
                        
                        3.  self-regulatory depletion
                        
                        4.  implications are that you can BUILD it up like a muscle
                        
                        5.  can build it using "value affirmation"
                        
                        6.  even when you think you have nothing less, there are ways to motivate yourself to increase your willpower reserve
                        
                        7.  meditation helps
                        
                            1.  [is that because it helps you recognize what you're doing from an external POV? what is that called?]
                            
                            2.  meditation helps attn, and attn helps willpower
                        
                        8.  "implementation intentions"
                        
                            1.  sort of like Ivy Lee method where you just say, "When X happens [e.g. done with task, end of talk], I'm going to do Y (read a paper), then Z"
                            
                                1.  prob esp helpful at beginning of day
                            
                            2.  "people who make implementation INTENTIONS tend to follow through"
                            
                            3.  (sort of like a super todo list, but tied together like triggers)
                            
                            4.  THIS is writing down the list of what to do today in nb
                            
                            5.  saying "i'm going to spend all day doing a task like writing" when you've NEVER spent the entire day doing that is not helpful &#x2013; what is helpful is finer granularity, like "11am-noon I'm going to write, then eat lunch, then 12.30-1.30 i'm going to write more"
                            
                                1.  that's also asking too much of a single interval
                                
                                2.  once you get into the habit of doing something like that more frequently, then you'll have more of it done and won't need to do it all at once
                    
                    4.  cognition and beliefs
                    
                        1.  how to intervene
                
                22. procr will stay up all night, do task, turn it in, feel great, but then not use that good feeling to do more work
                
                    1.  real learning should be constant (at lower magnitude), not stop and go with cramming and then unworking
                
                23. fear is the mind killer and the procrastinator

        1.  20130326 professional devlpmt talk
        
            -   lots of assumptions about attn during talks (esp w/ science)
            -   long pauses
            -   engagement w/ audience

        1.  sailing notes, day 1 2014-09-20
        
            -   agenda: the boat, wind, turning, knots
            -   can take (discounted) $39 multiple choice test after finishing class for most basic registration
            -   chris allen teaching
            -   "Courageous" an NPO, and "Community Sailing on the Charles" also recommended
            -   get 35 days of member sailing after class, that may roll over
            -   parts of boat
                -   omega symbol on sails means it's a student, everyone on water will see and understand that
                -   hullspeed eqn determines literally the max speed of the boat, f(length on water line) = 7 knots for solings
                    -   need 12-15 knots windspeed for max boat speed, but >15 knots doesn't make it any faster!
                -   need "one hand" of wtr b/w ground
                -   can't use tiller to brake
                    -   xxx "can't brake, can only take foot off the gas"
                -   heeling = when boat turns lat on its side
                -   "lines" = boat term for lines
                    -   can use "camp or cleat" to catch/sit lines near winches
                    -   you "trim" vs "ease" the line
                -   "blocks" = boat term for pulleys
                -   standing rigging = literally the rigging on it 24/7, even when at mooring
                -   running rigging = stuff like sails that you put on to go
                -   can BEND the sails like wings, which planes can't do
                -   can trim the aft stay to bend the mast (don't worry about plastic deformation)
                -   the boom is free in its range
                -   watch spongebob episode about parts of the boat/learning to drive
                -   luff = Leading edge of sail (see "luffing")
                -   clew = no clew what the name is, it's not the tack or head
                -   4 lines
                    1.  main halyard, hoists main sail up
                    2.  jib halyard
                    3.  jib sheet
                    4.  main sheet
                -   in rigging, you "tack on the tag" [connect the tack of both main and jib to their things]
                -   sails shaking = luffing [boat is telling you it wants directions]
                -   stays = permanent metal wire lines going up the mast connected to the boat. Frontmost stay is what the jib tack goes on
                -   jib sheet loosens/tightens jib clew
                -   "roaches and leeches" on main sail (leech is the perfect triangle, roach is the extra fabric on sail)
            -   port/starboard are fixed, but there are also wind-relative side terms "winward aka weatherside" and "leeward" (pron loohr-word)
            -   right of way: if starb = win, you have RoW
            -   "the boat leans to lee[side]" [but it wants to turn into winward/wants to approach the wind]
            -   helm = person holding the tiller, and sometimes the main sheet
            -   the wind
                -   spd and dir
                -   there exist nautical vs statue miles
                -   17 mph = 15 knots / good enough
                -   solings want 5-10 for learning, 10-15 is fun, >12 is intense
                -   there are smaller storm sails for high wind
                -   gusts are often 20 knots
                    -   gust mgmt is adv
                    -   can see them coming on the water sometimes
                -   0 is the worst wind speed
                -   Boston harbor wind mostly S-SW (meaning coming from)
                -   winds on the sail
                    -   when going upwind, front of sail is a high-pressure sys, back of sail is a low-pressure sys, which makes a lift vector called "attached airflow" or pilots call "laminar flow"
                    -   air on both sides reaches end of sail at same time
                    -   the lift vector is usually very perpendicular to the wind dir, but when combined with vertical keel hydrodynamics, makes an upwind vector
                    -   this all is called lift
                -   jib has red and green "telltales", and you want them BOTH to be strong
                    -   if inner red weak, trim it, and vice versa
                -   "when in doubt, let it out"
                -   leech has tails that come out in rear
                -   "points of sail" 360 degree wheel, from
                    -   into wind / "in irons",
                    -   "close reach" maximizing lift,
                    -   "beam reach" named for flat beam behind helm
                    -   "? reach" more downward, starting to use "drag" instead of lift
                -   wind coming on left side = "port tack", wind coming on starboard = "starboard tack"
                -   "head up" = turn nose to point up to source of wind
                    -   done by pulling tiller into wind
                    -   as opposed to "fall off"
                -   solings are good at not staying in irons
            -   turning the boat, aka "tacking"
                -   to turn, push tiller into sail
                -   pushes rear of boat around wrt the bow
                -   when tacking, don't need to adjust main, since is "self-tacking"
                -   NEVER let go of the tiller, also bad if not looking at front
                -   newbs tend to turn around when tacking - don't
                -   tacking the jib
                    -   when turning L, loosen the R jib line and pull the L line
            -   in irons is sometimes called the safety position
            -   xxx in "jibbing aka gybbing" (turning downwind), can get "uncontrolled jibe" where jib starts luffing and then turns around to be opposite the direction of the main; this is VERY bad, as the boom will then come snap around VERY quickly
            -   helmsman is "in the box"
            -   "listen to the jib"
            -   man overboard rescue is usually either a figure 8 or a "quick turn"
            -   knots: cleat hitch, bowlein, stopper knots (8, pigtail)
        
        2.  sailing notes, day 2 2014-09-21
        
            -   if going downwind in a far reach (can't remember exact phrasing), can be "sailing by the lee" where boom is still on the winward side
            -   **downwind : drag:** upwind : lift
            -   starb tack has RoW over port tack
            -   if get a "puff", can
                1.  let off main sail (best, simplest)
                2.  head into wind
                3.  sit differently
                    -   "the boat hates people"
                    -   "everyone should sit on the winward side => the boat will point to leeward"
            -   most difficult thing is keeping a course
            -   jib vs jibe
            -   best time to do jib during tack
                -   to release, just when jib? start luffing
                -   to tighten, wait until luff of jib crosses the mast
            -   he trusts candied ginger for seasickness/nausea
            -   "crash jibe" = immediately going to start a jibe bc of emergency, watch your head
            -   mooring
                -   exiting mooring
                    -   let the jib fully luff when unmooring
                    -   can artificially (aka with hands) tighten jib to get a kickstart
                        -   aka "backing the jib"
                        -   this is used to change dir, NOT to go fwd
                -   entering mooring
                    -   open the jib completely
                        -   this decr wind power
                        -   this change the handling too, so be careful
                    -   once "on the moor," should luff and/or drop main
                    -   can easily drop the sails by pulling on luff
                    -   xxx "luffing a sail" = loosening
                    -   can always "pass" on a particular mooring = good practice too
                    -   "shopping window" of potential moors is usu b/w 270 degrees and 320 degrees, if on a reach/going upwind
                    -   lots of mooring maneuvers exist
                    -   "sneak in from behind, let sails out early"
            -   man overboard
                -   important things
                    1.  cry out (say it)
                    2.  throw flotation, even if they're wearing a lifevest (so you can see the flotation)
                    3.  get a spotter who constantly maintains eyes and arm pointing on the person
                    
                    (4.) do NOT jump out, since more people in water = less control of boat; only jump in for elderly, invalid, or infants
                -   "quick turn" easiest, best
                    -   immediately turn to beam reach, go 5/6 boat lengths,
                    -   then jib,
                    -   then turn or tack to return to where the person is, loosening sails to slow down when close
            -   Balance
                -   CLR/"the pivot" = center of lat resistance, can rotate around this point/vertical line
                -   CE/"the push" = center of effort, midpoint of mass b/w the sails (and maybe people as well?), so it provides torque around the pivot, and change location depending on absolute and relative location of the sails
                -   knowing this really helps for better sailing
                -   "weatherhelm" is idea that boat tends to turn into the wind
                    -   this is by design, so it keeps you awake etc.
                    -   dealing with weatherhelm is newb stuff, you should be able to compensate
                    -   this includes that you need to "fight" the boat doing this to go in a straight line
                -   if strong wind, then main will get more, which shifts the push more to main
                -   if main gets too much push, can get enough weatherhelm so that the push is so rear that tilling isn't effective
                    -   letting main out is best solution to get rid of this
                    -   "the less balanced the boat, the less effective the rudder"
                        -   this includes heeling
                        -   too much heeling is inefficient
                -   bending the mast also moves the push to the rear
            -   leeway
                -   if trying to reach a point, should aim a little towards the source of wind to actually get there (have to go sideways a little)
                -   this can happen especially for tidal reasons (think of the hydrodyns of the keel)
                -   xxx read more about this
            -   rules of the road
                -   if vessel collision, EVERYONE is at fault
                -   diff boat classes has more or less RoW
                -   stand-on (so) or give-way (gw)
                -   gw means the boat with more control (often facing the wind more) has an easier time getting out of the way
                -   so means you should maintain your course and speed
                -   starb tack: if port tack and starb tack both going upwind and headed on collision course, port tack is gw and should move
                -   leeward boat: if in irons/close reach, and intercept w/ a beam reach boat, beam reach is gw and should move
                -   overtaken: ??
            -   big boats: 5 loud blasts = danger, idk what you're doing and I can't tell
            -   spinikerup = restricted maneurver (has RoW)
            -   Apparent Wind (AW)
                -   relative wind feeling
                -   often when you feel wind loss, it's this
                -   changing dir of AW
                    -   as boat goes forward, gradually wind vector will approach course
                    -   "your boat spd has bent the dir of the wind"
                -   if want more wind, head up, since AW incr, instead of falling down (which would give you a better angle)

            -   backing the jib = using your hands
                -   like when leaving mooring and want to turn
                -   if main is tight, then can make this much harder
            -   if someone falls off, can do
                1.  "quick stop" (where come by on downwind),
                2.  "figure 8" which is commonly taught since involves a tack instead of a jibe, and
                3.  "quick turn" which is what they taught me
            -   pick people up on WINWARD side of boat, not leeward &#x2013; wind can knock boat into person, better visibility
            -   weather-helm: when rear of boat becomes boss
                -   reduce it via
                    1.  let main out
                    2.  head up into wind
                    3.  tighten jib
            -   "fall-off" - away from wind
            -   jibe has less turning power then tack
            -   right of way: if both starb, tiebreaker is who gets wind first
        
        4.  sailing notes, day 4 2014-09-28
        
            -   bending mast = brings CE back and tightens
            -   outhaul = incr curvature of foot
                -   thing with the weird tie at bottom of boom
            -   cunningham helps upwind, most vertical portion of main
            -   fuller sails = "keep the wind"
            -   boom vang is how you take twist out

                -   dead reckoning - figuring outhere you are between two places you absolutely knoow where you are, like a buoy
                -   cross lines that you get
                -   range = where two tings line up
                -   bearing = looking at single thing
                -   all boats use mag north
                -   tide/current is like +- 4 degrees
                -   90 is the amount of leeway you must allow to the ???

                -   add high and low knoots are added to soundings
                -   be careful of supertide (goes below)
                -   hours of tide (roman numerals usu used):
                    1.  1/12 of tide comes in
                    2.  3/12
                    3.  6/12 (half the tide comes in the middle)

                -   going out: ebbing
                -   if current against, go shallow
                -   if with you, go deep
                    -   deeper water = stronger current
                -   wind and tide and current: don't have 2 of them against you
                -   "you plan tides and wind"
                -   we know about storms 4-5 days in advance
            
            3.  weather
            
                -   "anvil clouds" out of NW
                    -   if seem them, have 30 mins to get to shelter
                    -   turns cold at 10 minutes
                    -   squalls 15-30 min long, 25 knots
                    -   if get caught, drop sails, maybe store them
                -   everyone runs aground
                    -   think where you are in the tide cycle, wear lifejacker (if happens)
                    -   keel is the thing usu caught
                -   "topping lift" = same place a standing halyard, used to keep up the boom
                -   float plan = just tell somebody when/where going

                -   big boats
                    -   1 toot means "leaving you on port", 1 response means "yes", 5 means "no"
            
            4.  sail shapes
            
                -   wind at top of sail is much faster
                -   when wind faster, usu dir is diff
                -   so far, we've just been using the halyards just to raise sail, but can use it to change shape of jib or main
                -   loose sails can "hold" wind for longer
                -   jib down haul - pulls down jib tack to tighten
                -   pulling Cunningham allows more curvature in main
                -   can also loosen sail via loosening sail clews
                -   draft of sail = how curved it is?
                -   jubs and mains have backstays that can tighten
                -   jib fairlead (that's the things that you pull the jib lines through)
                    -   pulling back lets off gas
                -   twist (in main)
                    -   raise boom = allows twist
                    -   "boom vang" = triple pulley thing, cxn boom to mast
                    -   !!! "golden rule of sailing" = want top batten and boom aligned
            
            5.  buoyage
            
                -   magenta on maps = has a light

                    -   orange/red circle = advisory
                    -   orange/red square = warning
                    -   orange/red diamond = don't go, really bad

            1.  follow your own goals
            
            2.  first read overview/discovery, second for detail and understanding, third for notes which he means exec summary in your own words about all major points - discovery should be very small, just major things
            
            3.  use multiple "modes" for review, like talking, visualizing
            
            4.  author context
            
            5.  general arguments are far more important than details
            
            6.  know how long you're going to read
            
            7.  read as if you imagine you're going to have formal argu with author
            
            8.  one hour (and an initial fifteen for easing in) is a good time for concentration. 3 1hr sess are better than 1 3 hr sess
            
            9.  actually estimate times for reading!
            
            10. prefer margin notes that summ over highlights. And if highlighting, only words not sentences-want to minimize reread
            
            11. [standalone mental rehearsal?]

            2.  his email:by the way, when i've seen it used, the term "model optimization" usually refers to "parameter optimization".i'm using "model optimization" to refer to the optimization of the mathematical form of the model (i.e., the same way statisticians discuss finding the best statistical distribution to model data).
            
            3.  continuation:ok, one more addition - in practice, when statisticians talk about choosing the best distribution to model data, they are choosing a distribution from a discrete set where the choice is based on known properties of the different distributions.when i say "model optimization", i'm thinking more of an optimization by the **incremental variation** of a mathematical form (than property-based selection from a discrete set).however, if i were debating myself, i would point out that most distributions used in applied statistics are actually derivable from the gamma distribution (a well-known fact considered in the theoretical domain).thus, the continuous variation of gamma distribution parameters will sweep a range of mathematical forms (= that are commonly applied distributions) that could be optimized in the same sense i was describing.haha, ok, enough of that.

        2.  brian nosek says In writing, lead with the evidence, follow with the explanation.
        
        3.  writing essay to eric denovellis after briefly reading chapters of his thesis:
        
            (tl;dr: you often write sentences with many clauses, just like I do. For several reasons listed, it's probably a better idea to break most or ALL of those sentences with multiple clauses down into individual sentences.)
            
            essay:
            
            Also, do as I preach, not as I do. All this writing below is cursed by what exactly I'm saying that neither of us should do, but that we tend to do.
            
            simplify, simplify, simplify &#x2013; you write a ton like how I natively write, specifically subjects with lots of adjectives/etc., like 'context-relevant sensorimotor information'. Recently, Nancy did more than tear apart my attempt at an SFN abstract, to the point where she effectively rewrote the whole thing - and I couldn't deny that what she wrote was way more understandable. The key difference was shorter sentences. Much of the time I would be trying to say very, very related things together within the same sentence, since the science itself flows between them, but every single clause you add to a sentence adds SO much overhead if the person only 90% truly grasps what you said in the first clause.
            
            Honestly, multiple-clause stuff is probably fine in a thesis (where the main readers ARE going to be able to directly follow you easily since they have maybe even already read the papers you're discussing) . But if there's one thing that stuck out to me when I was doing a direct comparison between my writing (very similar to this) and Nancy's for the same piece of writing, was (being brutally honest here), how STUPID the latter was. I mean that the latter was better written, but honestly the grammar was so simple that a child could have read it, it was SO plain. There were many more short sentences, but just like a function, each one served one purpose and one purpose only. I tried thinking "how do i change my perspective to write like this" and honestly the first thought in my head was "write it like you would for someone super super dumb"&#x2026;and that's both horrifying that that was my thought, but also that was what made it great! As you read the simplistic version, your head responded like "Okay. Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah that follows. Yeah. uh-huh. Yep."
            
            By looking at the multiple clause sentences like right here at the end of page 91, i see the same thing I do natively, which I have to edit it out. Splitting up all these super-related clauses will, yes, make it sound less "professional" or academic&#x2026;but I think that's because it exactly makes it SIMPLER, and I'm of the opinion now that that helps the reader understand the stuff better than ANYTHING else.
            
            The very pseudoscientific way I think of it is, imagine your brain, the compartmentalization/compression of each of these major points is probably FAR better in your brain than in mine &#x2013; you've read these papers multiple times or at least have kicked around the key points and obvious things from the writing in your head for years, almost like you think of each of the ideas as if they are individual words. You encapsulate them in your mind very well, because you've spent years in grad school obsessing over these and related ideas. To someone else, even someone who is familiar (but not as much) with the work, each of these major points are going to be more like sentences. When I read "task demands' expected values increase" I have to process it, like "okay, the subject is task demands [which part is that in? let me look back a few sentences]&#x2026;okay&#x2026;now, what's it doing?". To you (just like propofol phase-amplitude coupling to me), that entire clause is a single "idea", fully encapsulated, but to someone else, it's an unknown connection between the subject, what's it's doing, and how that's different than a very similar effect on the same subject or vice versa, nevermind anatomical localizations. By the time I get to the next clause, I may (and was) still trying to process the first "connection" or result, as that's literally the first time I've been hit with it, and I need to learn it in order to move on. If two major points/results (from papers) are different clauses in the same sentence, then in all likelihood i'm still going to be trying to figure out what you exactly mean by the first as I'm moving onto the second, and then I'm trying to build two different connection/result ideas in my head, etc. Furthermore, I'm not going to have any idea if the second clause REQUIRES the first clause, or if they're completely independent (as they most of the time are).
            
            I think that, to someone who has extensively embedded such ideas in their head, each of these results/clauses are going to seem like single entities to them. For the same reason, several of these are going to be related, and it's going to be obvious that "result 1 is important, and result 2 is tied to result 1 so result 2 is this". But for the lay person, it's nontrivial just to figure out what result 1 is and all it entails, and putting more results in the same sentence is going to force them to almost try to parallelize figuring out results 1-3. I'm not saying this is a run-on since it's not, it's just a long sentence, but I think my pseudoscientific bullshit explanation above is a big part of why academics (people who understand a particular idea really, really, obsessively well) write such long sentences. YOU understand that "Ax=B" is Thereom 1, and so you say "Thm1, and Thm2, and Thm3", but for lay person seeing "Ax=B" the first time, it's harder on them than it is on you for understanding that the first time they see it. The "academic" way of writing would be this really long sentence (except in mathematics&#x2026;but we'll get to that), but I think the "simpler" way of splitting it up into, say, individual theorems that the reader attacks one at a time, goes a LONGGG way towards simplicity. That may actually be part of why Nancy's version of my writing was so much clearer: the separation between what constituted individual "ideas" is so much cleaner, almost like how math manuscripts don't go "Thm 1 => Thm 2 => Thm 3", but instead treat each of them one at a time. Separating by sentences also tells the reader "you don't need Thm1 to understand Thm2, as they're independent, and you can take all the time you want just to focus on the full sentence that is Thm1" Then, later, when you actually DO need Thm1 AND Thm2 to imply Thm3, you can refer to them using MUCH simpler terminology.
            
            I'm sending you both my and Nancy's abstracts so you can see the differences/superiority I'm talking about; honestly, it was a super good exercise for my understanding of writing differences to compare/contrast them. Doing so convinced me that 1. her way is better, and 2. it's just plain simpler. Just making the sentences shorter overall makes each of them THAT much easier to understand. It can almost make you sound like a simplistic robot, but the separation of ideas reduces cognitive load SO MUCH that I'm currently of the opinion that that is the MOST IMPORTANT thing to change in my own writing. And because you seem to write VERY similar to how I do, I think that same change seems relevant.

                1.  1. expectation: minimize distance b/w subject and verb
                
                2.  2. make each sentence ("unit of discourse", e.g. everything before a semicolon) on one thing and one thing only, or serve a single function, or make a single point
                
                3.  3. stress position/emphasis: put most important stuff at end of sentence
                
                4.  use the beginning of sentences to serve as "topic position" either for linkage to previously established material or predicting future points
                
                    1.  BUT don't start sentences constantly with brand-new ideas that haven't been introduced yet
                    
                    2.  don't use the begininng of sentences to give things their first appearance
                
                5.  "a sentence is too long when it has more candidates for stress positions than there are stress positions available"
                
                6.  number 1 problem in professional writing: misplacement of old and new (to the reader) information
                
                7.  [like i suspected] put OLD information at beginning topic position, put NEW information at ending stress position
                
                8.  always make sure to include connections to older information (linkages)
                
                9.  they consistently list out the main verbs of each sentence to examine the structure of the abstract
                
                10. "articulate the action of every sentence in its verb"
                
                11. provide context before giving new information
